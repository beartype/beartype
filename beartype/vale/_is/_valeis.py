class _IsFactory(_BeartypeValidatorFactoryABC):
    '''
    **Beartype callable validator factory** (i.e., class that, when subscripted
    (indexed) by an arbitrary callable returning ``True`` when the object
    passed to that callable satisfies a caller-defined constraint, creates a
    new :class:`BeartypeValidator` object encapsulating that callable suitable
    for subscripting (indexing) :attr:`typing.Annotated` type hints, enforcing
    that constraint on :mod:`beartype`-decorated callable parameters and
    returns annotated by those hints).

    This class validates that callable parameters and returns satisfy the
    arbitrary **callable validator** (i.e., callable whose signature satisfies
    ``collections.abc.Callable[[typing.Any], bool]``) subscripting (indexing)
    this class. Callable validators are caller-defined and may thus validate
    the internal integrity, consistency, and structure of arbitrary objects
    ranging from simple builtin scalars like integers and strings to complex
    data structures defined by third-party packages like NumPy arrays and
    Pandas DataFrames.

    This class creates one new :class:`BeartypeValidator` object for each
    callable validator subscripting (indexing) this class. These objects:

    * Are **PEP-compliant** and thus guaranteed to *never* violate existing or
      future standards.
    * Are **Safely ignorable** by *all* static and runtime type checkers other
      than :mod:`beartype` itself.
    * **Less efficient** than :class:`BeartypeValidator` objects created by
      subscripting every other :mod:`beartype.vale` class. Specifically:

      * Every :class:`BeartypeValidator` object created by subscripting this
        class necessarily calls a callable validator and thus incurs at least
        one additional call stack frame per :mod:`beartype`-decorated callable
        call.
      * Every :class:`BeartypeValidator` object created by subscripting every
        other :mod:`beartype.vale` class directly calls *no* callable and thus
        incurs additional call stack frames only when the active Python
        interpreter internally calls dunder methods (e.g., ``__eq__()``) to
        satisfy their validation constraint.

    Usage
    ----------
    Any :mod:`beartype`-decorated callable parameter or return annotated by a
    :attr:`typing.Annotated` type hint subscripted (indexed) by this class
    subscripted (indexed) by a callable validator (e.g.,
    ``typing.Annotated[{cls}, beartype.vale.Is[lambda obj: {expr}]]`` for any
    class ``{cls}``  and Python expression ``{expr}` evaluating to a boolean)
    validates that parameter or return value to be an instance of that class
    satisfying that callable validator.

    Specifically, callers are expected to (in order):

    #. Annotate a callable parameter or return to be validated with a
       :pep:`593`-compliant :attr:`typing.Annotated` type hint.
    #. Subscript that hint with (in order):

       #. The type expected by that parameter or return.
       #. One or more subscriptions (indexations) of this class, each itself
          subscripted (indexed) by a **callable validator** (i.e., callable
          accepting a single arbitrary object and returning either ``True`` if
          that object satisfies an arbitrary constraint *or* ``False``
          otherwise). If that hint is subscripted by:

          * Only one subscription of this class, that parameter or return
            satisfies that hint when both:

            * That parameter or return is an instance of the expected type.
            * That validator returns ``True`` when passed that parameter or
              return.

          * Two or more subscriptions of this class, that parameter or return
            satisfies that hint when both:

            * That parameter or return is an instance of the expected type.
            * *All* callable validators subscripting *all* subscriptions of
              this class return ``True`` when passed that parameter or return.

          Formally, the signature of each callable validator *must* resemble:

          .. code-block:: python

             def is_object_valid(obj) -> bool:
                 return bool(obj)

          Equivalently, each callable validator *must* satisfy the type hint
          ``collections.abc.Callable[[typing.Any,], bool]``. If not the case,
          an exception is raised. Note that:

          * If that parameter or return is *not* an instance of the expected
            type, **no callable validator is called.** Equivalently, each
            callable validator is called *only* when that parameter or return
            is already an instance of the expected type. Callable validators
            need *not* revalidate that type (e.g., by passing that parameter or
            return and type to the :func:`isinstance` builtin).
          * The name of each callable validator is irrelevant. For convenience,
            most callable validators are defined as nameless lambda functions.

    For example, the following type hint only accepts non-empty strings:

    .. code-block:: python

       Annotated[str, Is[lambda text: bool(text)]]

    :class:`BeartypeValidator` objects also support an expressive
    domain-specific language (DSL) enabling callers to trivially synthesize new
    objects from existing objects with standard Pythonic math operators:

    * **Negation** (i.e., ``not``). Negating an :class:`BeartypeValidator`
      object with the ``~`` operator synthesizes a new
      :class:`BeartypeValidator` object whose validator returns ``True`` only
      when the validator of the original object returns ``False``. For example,
      the following type hint only accepts strings containing *no* periods:

      .. code-block:: python

         Annotated[str, ~Is[lambda text: '.' in text]]

    * **Conjunction** (i.e., ``and``). Conjunctively combining two or more
      :class:`BeartypeValidator` objects with the ``&`` operator synthesizes a
      new :class:`BeartypeValidator` object whose validator returns ``True``
      only when all data validators of the original objects return ``True``.
      For example, the following type hint only accepts non-empty strings
      containing *no* periods:

      .. code-block:: python

         Annotated[str, (
              Is[lambda text: bool(text)] &
             ~Is[lambda text: '.' in text]
         )]

    * **Disjunction** (i.e., ``or``). Disjunctively combining two or more
      :class:`BeartypeValidator` objects with the ``|`` operator synthesizes a
      new :class:`BeartypeValidator` object whose validator returns ``True``
      only when at least one validator of the original objects returns
      ``True``. For example, the following type hint accepts both empty strings
      *and* non-empty strings containing at least one period:

      .. code-block:: python

         Annotated[str, (
             ~Is[lambda text: bool(text)] |
              Is[lambda text: '.' in text]
         )]

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This class is currently only supported by the** :func:`beartype.beartype`
    **decorator.** All other static and runtime type checkers silently ignore
    subscriptions of this class subscripting :attr:`typing.Annotated` type
    hints.

    **This class incurs a minor time performance penalty at call time.**
    Specifically, each type hint of a :mod:`beartype`-decorated callable
    subscripted by a subscription of this class adds one additional stack frame
    to each call of that callable. While negligible (in the average case), this
    cost can become non-negligible when compounded across multiple type hints
    annotating a frequently called :mod:`beartype`-decorated callable --
    especially when those type hints are subscripted by multiple subscriptions
    of this class at different nesting levels.

    **This class prohibits instantiation.** This class is *only* intended to be
    subscripted. Attempting to instantiate this class into an object will raise
    an :exc:`BeartypeValeSubscriptionException` exception.
