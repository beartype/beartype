# More specifically, why use this weird guard in addition to that
# IS_PYTHON_AT_LEAST_3_7 check below? Why not just create (and rely) on a
# dependency on typing-extensions when installing into Python 3.7? E.G.:
#
#     'install_requires': ('typing-extensions>=3.10;python_version<"3.8"'),
#
# Great questions! Thanks for asking!
#
# It turns out there is a principled reason and practical reason. Actually,
# there is a practical reason in line with principles, which we'll attempt to
# pass off as principle (which isn't very principled of us, but oh well).
#
# The practical reason is that (at least as of this writing) this file is
# ultimately imported from setup.py. This creates a potential circular
# dependency/bootstrapping problem. An installer evaluates setup.py to discover
# dependencies, but if this module is loaded in the process, and it requires
# that those dependencies are already available, installation breaks.
#
# Specifically, for Python 3.7, this module relies on typing-extensions for
# defining Protocol, but that probably isn't available at installation time. So
# we give up if we don't have it (just like we would do for Python 3.6).
#
# If we're robust enough to survive without a definition of Protocol at install
# time, we can certainly survive without it at runtime, too. In fact, we already
# do for Python 3.6. This means we don't require a strict dependency at all,
# which beartype hopes never to impose. Instead, we can leave that decision up
# to whomever is doing the installing. Further, the mechanism that person would
# almost certainly use to signal a need for access to Protocol in 3.7 is to
# install typing-extensions, which is the very same behavior that enables
# beartype to have it here. This maintains the appearance of an elegant design,
# when really all we were trying to do avoid the circular dependency at
# installation. #AccidentalGeniusForTheWin

        Caveats
        ----------
        **This metaclass will yield unpredictable results for any object with
        one or more methods not declared by the class of that object,**
        including objects whose methods are dynamically assembled at runtime.
        This metaclass is ill-suited for such "types."

        Motivation
        ----------
        Although any non-caching protocol can be coerced into a caching
        protocol through inheritance, the former will remain incompatible with
        runtime type checkers (including :mod:`beartype`) until explicitly
        decorated by :func:`typing.runtime_checkable`. As example:

        .. code-block:: python

          >>> from abc import abstractmethod
          >>> from typing import Protocol
          >>> from beartype.typing import _CachingProtocolMeta, runtime_checkable

          >>> @runtime_checkable
          ... class _MyProtocol(Protocol):  # plain vanilla protocol
          ...   @abstractmethod
          ...   def myfunc(self, arg: int) -> str:
          ...     pass

          >>> @runtime_checkable  # redundant, but useful for documentation
          ... class MyProtocol(
          ...   _MyProtocol,
          ...   Protocol,
          ...   metaclass=_CachingProtocolMeta,  # caching version
          ... ):
          ...   pass

          >>> class MyImplementation:
          ...   def myfunc(self, arg: int) -> str:
          ...     return str(arg * -2 + 5)

          >>> my_thing: MyProtocol = MyImplementation()
          >>> isinstance(my_thing, MyProtocol)
          True

        The easy way to ensure your protocol caches checks and is
        :func:`typing.runtime_checkable` is to inherit from
        :class:`beartype.typing.Protocol` instead:

        .. code-block:: python

          >>> from beartype.typing import Protocol

          >>> class MyBearProtocol(Protocol):
          ...   @abstractmethod
          ...   def myfunc(self, arg: int) -> str:
          ...     pass

          >>> my_thing: MyBearProtocol = MyImplementation()
