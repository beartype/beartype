**Beartype** :mod:`typing` **compatibility layer.**

This submodule declares the exact same set of **public typing attributes**
(i.e., module-scoped attributes listed by the :attr:`typing.__all__` global) as
declared by the :mod:`typing` module for your current Python version. Although
the attributes declared by this submodule *mostly* share the same values as
the attributes declared by :mod:`typing`, notable differences include:

* :pep:`585`-deprecated typing attributes. :pep:`585` deprecated **38 public
  typing attributes** to "...be removed from the typing module in the first
  Python version released 5 years after the release of Python 3.9.0." This
  submodule preserves those attributes under their original names for the
  Python 3.8-specific version of the :mod:`typing` module, thus preserving
  forward compatibility with future Python versions. These include:

  * :attr:`typing.AbstractSet`.
  * :attr:`typing.AsyncContextManager`.
  * :attr:`typing.AsyncGenerator`.
  * :attr:`typing.AsyncIterable`.
  * :attr:`typing.AsyncIterator`.
  * :attr:`typing.Awaitable`.
  * :attr:`typing.ByteString`.
  * :attr:`typing.Callable`.
  * :attr:`typing.ChainMap`.
  * :attr:`typing.Collection`.
  * :attr:`typing.Container`.
  * :attr:`typing.ContextManager`.
  * :attr:`typing.Coroutine`.
  * :attr:`typing.Counter`.
  * :attr:`typing.DefaultDict`.
  * :attr:`typing.Deque`.
  * :attr:`typing.Dict`.
  * :attr:`typing.FrozenSet`.
  * :attr:`typing.Generator`.
  * :attr:`typing.ItemsView`.
  * :attr:`typing.Iterable`.
  * :attr:`typing.Iterator`.
  * :attr:`typing.KeysView`.
  * :attr:`typing.List`.
  * :attr:`typing.Mapping`.
  * :attr:`typing.MappingView`.
  * :attr:`typing.Match`.
  * :attr:`typing.MutableMapping`.
  * :attr:`typing.MutableSequence`.
  * :attr:`typing.MutableSet`.
  * :attr:`typing.OrderedDict`.
  * :attr:`typing.Pattern`.
  * :attr:`typing.Reversible`.
  * :attr:`typing.Set`.
  * :attr:`typing.Tuple`.
  * :attr:`typing.Type`.
  * :attr:`typing.Sequence`.
  * :attr:`typing.ValuesView`.

Usage
----------
:mod:`beartype` users are strongly encouraged to import typing attributes from
this submodule rather than from :mod:`typing` directly: e.g.,

.. code-block:: python

   # Instead of this...
   from typing import Tuple, List, Dict, Set, FrozenSet, Type

   # ...always do this.
   from beartype.typing import Tuple, List, Dict, Set, FrozenSet, Type

#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# WARNING: To avoid polluting the public module namespace, external attributes
# *NOT* intended for public importation should be locally imported at module
# scope *ONLY* under alternate private names (e.g., "import re as _re" rather
# than merely "from re").
# WARNING: To preserve PEP 561 compliance with static type checkers (e.g.,
# mypy), external attributes *MUST* be explicitly imported with standard static
# import machinery rather than non-standard dynamic import shenanigans (e.g.,
# "from typing import Annotated" rather than
# "import_typing_attr_or_none('Annotated')").
