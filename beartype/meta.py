**Beartype metadata.**

This submodule exports global constants synopsizing this package -- including
versioning and dependencies.

For uniformity between this package and the ``pyproject.toml`` file describing
the installation of this package, this submodule also validates the version of
the active Python interpreter. An exception is raised if this version is
insufficient.

As a tradeoff between backward compatibility, security, and maintainability,
this package strongly attempts to preserve compatibility with the first stable
release of the oldest version of CPython still under active development. Hence,
obsolete and insecure versions of CPython that have reached their official End
of Life (EoL) (e.g., Python 3.5) are explicitly unsupported.

#FIXME: Switch! So, "pydata-sphinx-theme" is ostensibly *MOSTLY* great. However,
#there are numerous obvious eccentricities in "pydata-sphinx-theme" that we
#strongly disagree with -- especially that theme's oddball division in TOC
#heading levels between the top and left sidebars.
#
#Enter "sphinx-book-theme", stage left. "sphinx-book-theme" is based on
#"pydata-sphinx-theme", but entirely dispenses with all of the obvious
#eccentricities that hamper usage of "pydata-sphinx-theme". We no longer have
#adequate time to maintain custom documentation CSS against the moving target
#that is "pydata-sphinx-theme". Ergo, we should instead let "sphinx-book-theme"
#do all of that heavy lifting for us. Doing so will enable us to:
#* Lift the horrifying constraint above on a maximum Sphinx version. *gulp*
#* Substantially simplify our Sphinx configuration. Notably, the entire fragile
#  "doc/src/_templates/" subdirectory should be *ENTIRELY* excised away.
#
#Please transition to "sphinx-book-theme" as time permits.

# Note that documentation-time functionality in the Sphinx-specific
# "doc/src/conf.py" script imports this private string global. *shrug*
