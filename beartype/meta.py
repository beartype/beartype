**Beartype metadata.**

This submodule exports global constants synopsizing this package -- including
versioning and dependencies.

Python Version
----------
For uniformity between this codebase and the ``setup.py`` setuptools script
importing this module, this module also validates the version of the active
Python 3 interpreter. An exception is raised if this version is insufficient.

As a tradeoff between backward compatibility, security, and maintainability,
this package strongly attempts to preserve compatibility with the first stable
release of the oldest version of CPython still under active development. Hence,
obsolete and insecure versions of CPython that have reached their official End
of Life (EoL) (e.g., Python 3.5) are explicitly unsupported.

# Validate the version of the active Python interpreter *BEFORE* subsequent
# code possibly depending on this version. Since this version should be
# validated both at setuptools-based install time and post-install runtime
# *AND* since this module is imported sufficiently early by both, stash this
# validation here to avoid duplication of this logic and hence the hardcoded
# Python version.
#
# The "sys" module exposes three version-related constants for this purpose:
#
# * "hexversion", an integer intended to be specified in an obscure (albeit
#   both efficient and dependable) hexadecimal format: e.g.,
#    >>> sys.hexversion
#    33883376
#    >>> '%x' % sys.hexversion
#    '20504f0'
# * "version", a human-readable string: e.g.,
#    >>> sys.version
#    2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jul 31 2008, 17:28:52)
#    [GCC 4.2.3 (Ubuntu 4.2.3-2ubuntu7)]
# * "version_info", a tuple of three or more integers *OR* strings: e.g.,
#    >>> sys.version_info
#    (2, 5, 2, 'final', 0)
#
# For sanity, this package will *NEVER* conditionally depend upon the
# string-formatted release type of the current Python version exposed via the
# fourth element of the "version_info" tuple. Since the first three elements of
# that tuple are guaranteed to be integers *AND* since a comparable 3-tuple of
# integers is declared above, comparing the former and latter yield the
# simplest and most reliable Python version test.
#
# Note that the nearly decade-old and officially accepted PEP 345 proposed a
# new field "requires_python" configured via a key-value pair passed to the
# call to setup() in "setup.py" (e.g., "requires_python = ['>=2.2.1'],"), that
# field has yet to be integrated into either disutils or setuputils. Hence,
# that field is validated manually in the typical way.

# WARNING: When modifying the current version of this package below,
# consider adhering to the Semantic Versioning schema. Specifically, the
# version should consist of three "."-delimited integers
# "{major}.{minor}.{patch}", where:
#
# * "{major}" specifies the major version, incremented only when either:
#   * Breaking backward compatibility in this package's public API.
#   * Implementing headline-worthy functionality (e.g., a GUI). Technically,
#     this condition breaks the Semantic Versioning schema, which stipulates
#     that *ONLY* changes breaking backward compatibility warrant major bumps.
#     But this is the real world. In the real world, significant improvements
#     are rewarded with significant version changes.
#   In either case, the minor and patch versions both reset to 0.
# * "{minor}" specifies the minor version, incremented only when implementing
#   customary functionality in a manner preserving such compatibility. In this
#   case, the patch version resets to 0.
# * "{patch}" specifies the patch version, incremented only when correcting
#   outstanding issues in a manner preserving such compatibility.
#
# When in doubt, increment only the minor version and reset the patch version.
