#FIXME: The BeartypeForwardScope.__init__() "scope_dict: LexicalScope" parameter
#should probably instead be typed as:
#from collections import ChainMap
#...
#    def __init__(self, scope_dict: ChainMap, scope_name: str) -> None:
#
#Why? Because "ChainMap" exists to literally solve this *EXACT* problem.
#Notably, the current approach effectively forces a "BeartypeForwardScope" to
#take a possibly desynchronized "snapshot" of a lexical scope at a certain point
#in time. If either the locals or globals of that scope are subsequently
#modified by an external caller, however, that "BeartypeForwardScope" will then
#be desynchronized from those locals and globals.
#
#A "ChainMap" trivially resolves this. How? Internally, a "ChainMap" only
#holds *REFERENCES* to external locals and globals dictionaries. External
#updates to those external dictionaries are thus *IMMEDIATELY* reflected inside
#the "ChainMap" itself, resolving any desynchronization woes. *facepalm*

        Attributes
        ----------
        scope_dict : LexicalScope
            **Composite local and global scope** (i.e., dictionary mapping from
            the name to value of each locally and globally accessible attribute
            in the local and global scope of some class or callable) underlying
            this forward scope.

            Crucially, **this dictionary must composite both the local and
            global scopes for that class or callable.** This dictionary must
            *not* provide only the local or global scope; this dictionary must
            provide both. Why? Because this forward scope is principally
            intended to be passed as the second and last parameter to the
            :func:`eval` builtin, called by the
            :func:`beartype._check.forward.fwdresolve.resolve_hint` function. For
            unknown reasons, :func:`eval` only calls the :meth:`__missing__`
            dunder method of this forward scope when passed only two parameters
            (i.e., when passed only a global scope); :func:`eval` does *not*
            call the :meth:`__missing__` dunder method of this forward scope
            when passed three parameters (i.e., when passed both a global and
            local scope). Presumably, this edge case pertains to the official
            :func:`eval` docstring -- which reads:

                The globals must be a dictionary and locals can be any mapping,
                defaulting to the current globals and locals.
                If only globals is given, locals defaults to it.

            Clearly, :func:`eval` treats globals and locals fundamentally
            differently (probably for efficiency or obscure C implementation
            details). Since :func:`eval` only supports a single unified globals
            dictionary for our use case, the caller *must* composite together
            the global and local scopes into this dictionary. Praise to Guido.
        scope_name : str
            Fully-qualified name of this forward scope. For example:

            * ``"some_package.some_module"`` for a module scope (e.g., to
              resolve a global class or callable against this scope).
            * ``"some_package.some_module.SomeClass"`` for a class scope (e.g.,
              to resolve a nested class or callable against this scope).

        Dunder method explicitly called by the superclass

        ``]``-delimited attempt to access an **unresolved type hint** (i.e.,
        *not* currently defined in this scope) with the passed name.

        This dunder method transparently replaces this unresolved type hint with
        a **forward reference proxy** (i.e., concrete subclass of the private
        :class:`beartype._check.forward.reference.fwdrefabc.BeartypeForwardRefABC`
        abstract base class (ABC), which resolves this type hint on the first
        call to the :func:`isinstance` builtin whose second argument is that
        subclass).

        This dunder method assumes that:

        * This scope is only partially initialized.
        * This type hint has yet to be declared in this scope.
        * This type hint will be declared in this scope by the later time that
          this dunder method is called.

        Caveats
        -------
        **This dunder method is susceptible to misuse by third-party frameworks
        that perform call stack inspection.** The higher-level
        :func:`beartype._check.forward.fwdresolve.resolve_hint` internally invokes
        this dunder method by calling the :func:`eval` builtin, which then adds
        a new stack frame to the call stack whose ``f_locals`` and ``f_globals``
        attributes are this dictionary. If a third-party framework introspects
        the call stack containing this new stack frame, this dictionary's
        failure to conform to the behavior of a lexical scope could induce
        failure in that third-party framework. Does this edge case arise in
        real-world usage, though? It does.

        Consider ``pytest``, which detects whether each frame on the call stack
        defines the ``pytest``-specific ``__tracebackhide__`` dunder attribute:

        .. code-block:: python

           def ishidden(self, excinfo: ExceptionInfo[BaseException] | None) -> bool:
               """Return True if the current frame has a var __tracebackhide__
               resolving to True.

               If __tracebackhide__ is a callable, it gets called with the
               ExceptionInfo instance and can decide whether to hide the traceback.

               Mostly for internal use.
               """
               tbh: bool | Callable[[ExceptionInfo[BaseException] | None], bool] = False
               for maybe_ns_dct in (self.frame.f_locals, self.frame.f_globals):
                   # in normal cases, f_locals and f_globals are dictionaries
                   # however via `exec(...)` / `eval(...)` they can be other types
                   # (even incorrect types!).
                   # as such, we suppress all exceptions while accessing __tracebackhide__
                   try:
                       tbh = maybe_ns_dct["__tracebackhide__"]
                   except Exception:
                       pass
                   else:
                       break
               if tbh and callable(tbh):
                   return tbh(excinfo)

        In obscure edge cases involving :mod:`beartype`, ``pytest``, and
        :pep:`563`, one or both of the ``self.frame.f_locals`` and/or
        ``self.frame.f_globals`` dictionaries are instances of the
        :class:`beartype._check.forward.fwdscope.BeartypeForwardScope`
        dictionary subclass. The ``tbh = maybe_ns_dct["__tracebackhide__"]``
        statement then implicitly invokes this dunder method, which then creates
        and returns a new forward reference proxy encapsulating the missing
        ``__tracebackhide__`` attribute: e.g.,

        .. code-block:: python

           tbh = <forwardref__tracebackhide__(
                     __name_beartype__='__tracebackhide__',
                     __scope_name_beartype__='beartype_test.a00_unit.data.pep.pep563.pep695.data_pep563_pep695'
           )>

        Since forward reference proxies are types *and* since types are callable
        (in the sense that "calling" a type instantiates that type), forward
        reference proxies are callable. However, they're not. The
        :class:`beartype._check.forward.reference.fwdrefabc.BeartypeForwardRefABC`
        superclass prohibits instantiation by defining a ``__new__()`` dunder
        method that unconditionally raises exceptions, which then induces the
        ``pytest`` to raise the same exceptions on attempting to
        ``return tbh(excinfo)``.

        This dunder method avoids that and all similar issues by:

        * Detecting whether this dunder method is called by a caller defined
          inside or outside the :mod:`beartype` codebase.
        * If this dunder method is called by a caller defined inside the
          :mod:`beartype` codebase, creating and returning a forward reference
          proxy.
        * If this dunder method is called by a caller defined outside the
          :mod:`beartype` codebase, raising a standard :class:`AttributeError`.
