    **Forward reference metaclass** (i.e., metaclass of the
    :class:`.BeartypeForwardRefABC` superclass deferring the resolution of a
    stringified type hint referencing an attribute that has yet to be defined
    and annotating a class or callable decorated by the
    :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).

    This metaclass memoizes each **forward reference** (i.e.,
    :class:`.BeartypeForwardRefABC` instance) according to the fully-qualified
    name of the attribute referenced by that forward reference. Doing so ensures
    that only the first :class:`.BeartypeForwardRefABC` instance referring to a
    unique attribute is required to dynamically resolve that attribute at
    runtime; all subsequent :class:`.BeartypeForwardRefABC` instances referring
    to the same attribute transparently reuse the attribute previously resolved
    by the first such instance, effectively reducing the time cost of resolving
    forward references to a constant-time operation with negligible constants.

    This metaclass dynamically and efficiently resolves each forward reference
    in a just-in-time (JIT) manner on the first :func:`isinstance` call whose
    second argument is that forward reference. Forward references *never* passed
    to the :func:`isinstance` builtin are *never* resolved, which is good.

        '''
        **Forward referee** (i.e., type hint referenced by this forward
        reference subclass, which is usually but *not* necessarily a class).

        This class property is manually memoized for efficiency. However, note
        this class property is *not* automatically memoized (e.g., by the
        ``property_cached`` decorator). Why? Because manual memoization enables
        other functionality in the beartype codebase to explicitly unmemoize all
        previously memoized forward referees across all forward reference
        proxies, effectively forcing all subsequent calls of this property
        across all forward reference proxies to reimport their forward referees.
        Why is that desirable? Because other functionality in the beartype
        codebase detects when the user has manually reloaded user-defined
        modules defining user-defined types annotating user-defined callables
        previously decorated by the :mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator. Since
        reloading those modules redefines those types, all previously cached
        types (including those memoized by this property) *must* then be assumed
        to be invalid and thus uncached. In short, manual memoization allows
        beartype to avoid desynchronization between memoized and actual types.

        This class property is officially in the public :mod:`beartype` API and
        guaranteed to be available across *all* current and future
        :mod:`beartype` releases.

        Caveats
        -------
        Downstream callers consuming callable type hints modified by a
        previously applied :mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator may occasionally
        encounter **forward reference proxies** (i.e., instances of this
        metaclass). Forward reference proxies are *not* intended to be usable as
        perfect substitutes for the underlying classes they proxy. Instead,
        downstream callers are recommended to manually resolve these proxies to
        the underlying classes they proxy by accessing this property. Consider
        this trivial one-liner that does so for a type hint ``type_hint``:

        .. code-block:: python

           # If this type hint is actually a @beartype-specific forward
           # reference proxy that only refers to the desired type hint,
           # dereference that proxy to obtain that type hint.
           type_hint = getattr(type_hint, '__type_beartype__', type_hint)

        Raises
        ------
        BeartypeCallHintForwardRefException
            If either:

            * This forward referee is unimportable.
            * This forward referee is importable but either:

              * Not a type.
              * A type that is this forward reference proxy, implying this proxy
                circularly proxies itself.

**Forward reference referee cache** (i.e., dictionary mapping from each forward
reference proxy to the arbitrary class referred to by that proxy).

This cache serves a dual purpose. Notably, this cache both enables:

* External callers to iterate over all previously instantiated forward reference
  proxies. This is particularly useful when responding to module reloading,
  which requires that *all* previously cached types be uncached.
* The
  :attr:`.BeartypeForwardRefMeta.__type_beartype__` property to internally
  memoize the arbitrary class referred to by this referee. Since the existing
  ``property_cached`` decorator could trivially do so as well, however, this is
  only a negligible side effect.
