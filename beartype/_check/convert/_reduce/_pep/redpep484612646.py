# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: [PEP 612] *WOOPS.* Generics can be subscripted by PEP 612-compliant
#parameter specifications: e.g.,
#    # This example literally appears in PEP 696.
#    Ts = TypeVarTuple("Ts")
#    P = ParamSpec("P", default=[float, bool])
#    class Foo(Generic[Ts, P]): ...  # Valid
#
#Brutal. Welp. Let's implement that if somebody actually complains about that,
#please. Doing so will warrant renaming this reducer to "redpep484612646" and
#generalizing everything below. Pretty annoying, but... what can you do? *sigh*

#FIXME: [PEP 696] Handle "PEP 696 â€“ Type Defaults for Type Parameters" under
#Python >= 3.13:
#    https://peps.python.org/pep-0696
#
#This PEP induces edge cases in _make_hint_pep484612646_typearg_to_hint().
#Notably, when the caller passes more type parameters than child hints to that
#factory, we currently silently ignore and thus preserve those "excess" type
#parameters. Under Python >= 3.13, however, we *MUST* instead now:
#* Manually iterate over those any excess *LEADING* type parameters in
#  left-to-right parametrization order. For each such parameter:
#  * If that type parameter defines a default, map that parameter to that
#    default.
#  * Else, halt this iteration immediately.
#
#Note that:
#* Some (or even all) of the above logic may actually already be implicitly
#  supported due to the reduce_hint_pep484612646_typearg() reducer, which now
#  supports PEP 696-compliant defaults.
#* This does apply to both PEP 484-compliant type variables *AND* PEP
#  646-compliant unpacked type variable tuples. Both can be defaulted.
#* This does *NOT* apply to *TRAILING* type parameters. PEP 696 mandates that
#  @beartype should raise an exception if *ANY* trailing type parameter
#  following an unpacked type variable tuple has a default. Just "Ugh!"

    Reduce the passed :pep:`484`-, :pep:`612`-, or :pep:`646`-compliant **type

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type parameter to be reduced.
    hint_parent_sane : Optional[HintSane]
        Either:

        * If the passed hint is a **root** (i.e., top-most parent hint of a tree
          of child hints), :data:`None`.
        * Else, the passed hint is a **child** of some parent hint. In this
          case, the **sanified parent type hint metadata** (i.e., immutable and
          thus hashable object encapsulating *all* metadata previously returned

    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    All remaining keyword-only parameters are silently ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    HintSane
        Either:

        * If this type parameter is **recursive** (i.e., previously transitively
          mapped to itself by a prior call to this reducer), this type parameter
          *must* be ignored to avoid infinite recursion. In this case, the

        * Else if the type parameter lookup table encapsulated by the passed
          sanified parent type hint metadata maps this type parameter to another
          type hint, the latter.
        * Else if this type parameter is both unbounded and unconstrained, this

    Reduce the passed **subscripted hint** (i.e., derivative hint produced by
    subscripting an unsubscripted hint originally parametrized by one or more
    **type parameters** (i.e., :pep:`484`-compliant type variables or
    :pep:`646`-compliant type variable tuples) with one or more child hints) to
    that unsubscripted hint and corresponding **type parameter lookup table**
    (i.e., immutable dictionary mapping from those same type parameters to those
    same child hints).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``callable_cached`` decorator), as reducers cannot be memoized.

    Caveats
    -------
    This reducer does *not* validate these type parameters to actually be type
    parameters. Instead, this function defers that validation to the caller.
    Why? Efficiency, mostly. Avoiding the need to explicitly validate these type
    parameters reduces the underlying mapping operation to a fast one-liner.

    Let:

    * ``hints_typearg`` be the tuple of the zero or more type parameters
      parametrizing the unsubscripted hint underlying the passed subscripted
      hint.
    * ``hints_child`` be the tuple of the zero or more child hints subscripting
      the passed subscripted hint.

    Then this reducer validates the sizes of these tuple to be constrained as:

    .. code-block:: python

       len(hints_typearg) >= len(hints_child) > 0

    Equally, the passed hint *must* be subscripted by at least one child hint.
    For each such child hint, the unsubscripted hint originating this
    subscripted hint *must* be parametrized by a corresponding type parameter.
    The converse is *not* the case, as:

    * For the first type parameter, there also *must* exist a corresponding
      child hint to map to that type parameter.
    * For *all* type parameters following the first, there need *not* exist a
      corresponding child hint to map to that type parameter. Type parameters
      with *no* corresponding child hints are simply silently ignored (i.e.,
      preserved as type parameters rather than mapped to other hints).

    Equivalently:

    * Both of these tuples *must* be **non-empty** (i.e., contain one or more
      items).
    * This tuple of type parameters *must* contain at least as many items as
      this tuple of child hints. Therefore:

      * This tuple of type parameters *may* contain exactly as many items as
        this tuple of child hints.
      * This tuple of type parameters *may* contain strictly more items than
        this tuple of child hints.
      * This tuple of type parameters must *not* contain fewer items than this
        tuple of child hints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Subscripted hint to be inspected.
    hint_parent_sane : Optional[HintSane]
        Either:

        * If the passed hint is a **root** (i.e., top-most parent hint of a tree
          of child hints), :data:`None`.
        * Else, the passed hint is a **child** of some parent hint. In this
          case, the **sanified parent type hint metadata** (i.e., immutable and
          thus hashable object encapsulating *all* metadata previously returned
          by :mod:`beartype._check.convert.convmain` sanifiers after
          sanitizing the possibly PEP-noncompliant parent hint of this child
          hint into a fully PEP-compliant parent hint).

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages. Defaults
        to the empty string.

    Returns
    -------
    HintOrSane
        Either:

        * If the unsubscripted hint (e.g., :class:`typing.Generic`) originating
          this subscripted hint (e.g., ``typing.Generic[S, T]``) is
          unparametrized by type parameters, that unsubscripted hint as is.
        * Else, that unsubscripted hint is parametrized by one or more type
          parameters. In this case, the **sanified type hint metadata** (i.e.,
          :class:`.HintSane` object) describing this reduction.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484612646Exception
        If this type hint is unsubscripted.
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484TypeVarViolation
        If one of these type hints violates the bounds or constraints of one of
        these type parameters.

_TYPEARG_RECURSABLE_DEPTH_MAX = 0
'''
Value of the optional ``hint_recursable_depth_max`` parameter passed to the
:func:`.is_hint_recursive` tester by the :func:`.reduce_hint_pep484_typevar`
reducer.

This depth ensures that :pep:`484`- or :pep:`646`-compliant type parameters are
considered to be recursive *only* after having been recursed into at most this
many times before (i.e., *only* after having been visited exactly once as a
child hint of an arbitrary parent hint). By definition, type parameters are
guaranteed to *never* be parent hints. Ergo, recursing into type parameters
exactly once suffices to expand exactly one nesting level of non-trivial
recursive data structures. This mirrors the restrained recursion allowed by
other reducers.

Consider :pep:`695`-compliant type aliases, for example. Unlike type parameters,
type aliases are guaranteed to *always* be parent hints. The value of the
optional ``hint_recursable_depth_max`` parameter passed to the
:func:`.is_hint_recursive` tester by :pep:`695`-specific reducers is thus one
greater than the value of this global. Nonetheless, the real-world effect is
exactly the same: exactly one nesting level of type aliases is expanded.

Consider the following :pep:`484`-compliant generic recursively subscripted by
itself via a :pep:`484`-compliant type variable ``T``:

.. code-block:: python

   class GenericList[T](): ...
   RecursiveGenericList = GenericList[GenericList]

Instances of this generic satisfying the type hint ``RecursiveGenericList``
contain an arbitrary number of other instances of this generic, exhibiting this
internal structure:

.. code-block:: python

   recursive_generic_list = GenericList()
   recursive_generic_list.append(recursive_generic_list)

Halting recursion at the first expansion of the type parameter ``T`` then
reduces the type hint ``RecursiveGenericList`` to
``GenericList[GenericList[T]]``, , which reduces to
``GenericList[GenericList[HINT_SANE_RECURSIVE]]``, , which reduces to
``GenericList[GenericList]`` -- conveying exactly one layer of the internal
semantics of this recursive data structure.
