Project-wide :pep:`484`- or :pep:`604`-compliant **union reducers** (i.e.,
low-level callables converting union type hints to lower-level type hints more
readily consumable by :mod:`beartype`).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def reduce_hint_pep484604(hint: Hint, **kwargs) -> Hint:
    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`604`-compliant union to the
    ignorable :obj:`typing.Any` singleton if this union is subscripted by one or
    more **ignorable child hints** (i.e., hints that themselves reduce to the
    ignorable :obj:`typing.Any` singleton) *or* preserve this union as is
    otherwise (i.e., if this union is subscripted by *no* ignorable child
    hints).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``callable_cached`` decorator), as reducers cannot be memoized.

    Design
    ------
    This reducer recursively reduces all child hints subscripting this union as
    a necessary prerequisite to deciding whether one or more of these hints are
    ignorable. Since one or more of these child hints may require an uncached
    reduction in the worst case, reducing unions *also* requires an uncached
    reduction in the worst case. This is that case.

    This reducer ignores all union factories subscripted by one or more
    ignorable child hints, including:

    * The :pep:`484`-compliant :obj:`typing.Optional` (e.g.,
      ``typing.Optional[object]``).
    * The :pep:`484`-compliant :obj:`typing.Union` (e.g.,
      ``typing.Union[typing.Any, bool]``).
    * All :pep:`604`-compliant new-style unions (e.g., ``bool | object``).

    Why? Because unions are by definition only as narrow as their widest child
    hint. However, shallowly ignorable type hints are ignorable precisely
    because they are the widest possible hints (e.g., :class:`object`,
    :attr:`typing.Any`), which are so wide as to constrain nothing and convey no
    meaningful semantics. A union of one or more shallowly ignorable child hints
    is thus the widest possible union, which is so wide as to constrain nothing
    and convey no meaningful semantics. Since there exist a countably infinite
    number of possible :data:`Union` subscriptions by one or more ignorable type
    hints, these subscriptions *cannot* be explicitly listed in the
    :data:`beartype._data.hint.pep.datapeprepr.HINTS_REPR_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW`
    frozenset. Instead, these subscriptions are dynamically detected by this
    tester at runtime and thus referred to as **deeply ignorable type hints.**

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : HintPep695TypeAlias
        Union to be reduced.

    All remaining passed keyword parameters are passed to the parent
    :func:`beartype._check.convert._reduce.redhint.reduce_hint` function
    recursively called by this reducer.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        Either:

        * If this union is subscripted by one or more ignorable child hints,
          :obj:`typing.Any`.
        * Else, this union unmodified.
