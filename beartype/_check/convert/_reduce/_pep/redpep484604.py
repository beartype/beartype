Project-wide :pep:`484`- or :pep:`604`-compliant **union reducers** (i.e.,

    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`604`-compliant union to the ignorable
    :data:`.HINT_SANE_IGNORABLE` singleton if this union is subscripted by one or
    more **ignorable child hints** (i.e., hints that themselves reduce to the
    ignorable :data:`.HINT_SANE_IGNORABLE` singleton) *or* preserve this union as is
    otherwise (i.e., if this union is subscripted by *no* ignorable child
    hints).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``callable_cached`` decorator), as reducers cannot be memoized.

    Design
    ------
    This reducer recursively reduces all child hints subscripting this union as
    a necessary prerequisite to deciding whether one or more of these hints are
    ignorable. Since one or more of these child hints may require an uncached
    reduction in the worst case, reducing unions *also* requires an uncached
    reduction in the worst case. This is that case.

    This reducer ignores all union type hint factories subscripted by one or
    more ignorable child hints, including:

    * The :pep:`484`-compliant :obj:`typing.Optional` (e.g.,
      ``typing.Optional[object]``).
    * The :pep:`484`-compliant :obj:`typing.Union` (e.g.,
      ``typing.Union[typing.Any, bool]``).
    * All :pep:`604`-compliant new-style unions (e.g., ``bool | object``).

    Why? Because unions are only as narrow as their widest child type hints.
    Shallowly ignorable hints are ignorable exactly because they are the widest
    possible hints (e.g., :class:`object`, :data:`.HINT_SANE_IGNORABLE`), which are
    so wide as to constrain nothing and convey no meaningful semantics. A union
    of one or more shallowly ignorable child hints is thus the widest possible
    union, which is so wide as to constrain nothing and convey no meaningful
    semantics. There exist a countably infinite number of possible unions
    subscripted by one or more ignorable child hints. Ergo, these subscriptions
    *cannot* be explicitly listed in the
    :data:`beartype._data.hint.pep.datapeprepr.HINTS_REPR_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW`
    set. Instead, these subscriptions are dynamically detected by this tester at
    runtime and thus referred to as **deeply ignorable unions.**

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : HintPep695TypeAlias
        Union hint to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    All remaining passed keyword parameters are passed to the parent
    :func:`beartype._check.convert._reduce.redhint.reduce_hint` function
    recursively called by this reducer.

    Returns
    -------
    HintOrSane
        Either:

        * If this union is subscripted by one or more ignorable child hints,
          :data:`.HINT_SANE_IGNORABLE`.
        * Else, this union unmodified.

    # In this case, reduce this union to the ignorable "HINT_SANE_IGNORABLE"
    # singleton.
    #
    # Why are unsubscripted unions ignorable? First, consider the case of the
    # unsubscripted "typing.Union" type hint factory. When unsubscripted, this
    # factory semantically expands to the implicit "Union[Any]" singleton by the
    # same argument. Since PEP 484 stipulates that a union of one type
    # semantically reduces to only that type, "Union[Any]" semantically reduces
    # to merely "Any". Despite their semantic equivalency, however, these
    # objects remain syntactically distinct with respect to object
    # identification: e.g.,
    #     >>> Union is not Union[Any]
    #     True
    #     >>> Union is not Any
    #     True
    #
    # This intentionally excludes:
    # * The "Union[Any]" and "Union[object]" singletons, since the "typing"
    #   module physically reduces:
    #   * "Union[Any]" to merely "Any" (i.e., "Union[Any] is Any"), which is
    #     already ignored by reducers elsewhere.
    #   * "Union[object]" to merely "object" (i.e., "Union[object] is
    #     object"), which is already ignored by reducers elsewhere.
    # * The "Union" singleton subscripted by one or more ignorable type hints
    #   contained in this set (e.g., "Union[Any, bool, str]"). Since there exist
    #   a countably infinite number of these subscriptions, these subscriptions
    #   are recursively detected below.
    #
    # Next, consider the case of the unsubscripted "typing.Optional" type hint
    # factory. When unsubscripted, this factory semantically expands to the
    # implicit "Optional[Any]" singleton by the same argument. Since PEP 484
    # also stipulates that all "Optional[t]" singletons semantically expand to
    # "Union[t, type(None)]" singletons for arbitrary arguments "t",
    # "Optional[Any]" semantically expands to merely "Union[Any, type(None)]".
    # Since all unions subscripted by "Any" semantically reduce to merely "Any",
    # the "Optional" singleton also reduces to merely "Any".
    #
    # This intentionally excludes "Optional[type(None)]", which the "typing"
    # module physically reduces to merely "type(None)". *shrug*
