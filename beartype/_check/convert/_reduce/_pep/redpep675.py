'''
Project-wide :pep:`675`-compliant **literal string type hint reducers** (i.e.,
low-level callables converting higher-level type hints created by subscripting
the :obj:`typing.LiteralString` type hint factory to lower-level type hints more
readily consumable by :mod:`beartype`).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def reduce_hint_pep675(hint: Hint, exception_prefix: str) -> Type[str]:
    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`675`-compliant **literal string type hint** (i.e.,
    :obj:`typing.LiteralString` singleton) to the builtin :class:`str` class as
    advised by :pep:`675` when performing runtime type-checking.

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``callable_cached`` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces to a
    one-liner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    Returns
    -------
    Type[str]
        Builtin :class:`str` class.
    '''

    # Unconditionally reduce this hint to the builtin "str" class.
