Project-wide :pep:`593`-compliant **type metahint reducers** (i.e., low-level
low-level callables converting higher-level type hints created by subscripting
the :obj:`typing.Annotated` type hint factory to lower-level type hints more
readily consumable by :mod:`beartype`).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def reduce_hint_pep593(hint: Hint, exception_prefix: str) -> Hint:
    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`593`-compliant **type metahint** (i.e., subscription
    of the :obj:`typing.Annotated` hint factory) to a lower-level hint if this
    metahint contains *no* **beartype validators** (i.e., subscriptions of
    :mod:`beartype.vale` factories).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``callable_cached`` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces to a
    one-liner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        Lower-level type hint currently supported by :mod:`beartype`.
