Project-wide :pep:`484`- and :pep:`585`-compliant **subclass hint reducers** (i.e.,
low-level callables converting higher-level subscripted and unsubscripted
:pep:`484`-compliant ``typing.Type[...]`` and :pep:`585`-compliant ``type[...]``
hints to lower-level hints more readily consumable by :mod:`beartype`).

def reduce_hint_pep484585_type(
    hint: Hint, exception_prefix: str, **kwargs) -> Hint:
    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant **subclass hint**
    (i.e., hint constraining objects to subclass that superclass) to the
    :class:`type` superclass if that hint is subscripted by an ignorable child
    hint *or* preserve this hint as is otherwise (i.e., if this hint is *not*
    subscripted by an ignorable child hint).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as reducers cannot be memoized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Subclass type hint to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message.

    All remaining passed keyword parameters are silently ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        Lower-level hint reduced from this subclass hint.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484585Exception
        If this hint is neither a :pep:`484`- nor :pep:`585`-compliant subclass
        hint.
