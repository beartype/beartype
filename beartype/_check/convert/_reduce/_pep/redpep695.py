    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Subscripted hint to be inspected.
    hint_parent_sane : Optional[HintSane]
        Either:

        * If the passed hint is a **root** (i.e., top-most parent hint of a tree
          of child hints), :data:`None`.
        * Else, the passed hint is a **child** of some parent hint. In this
          case, the **sanified parent type hint metadata** (i.e., immutable and
          thus hashable object encapsulating *all* metadata previously returned
          by :mod:`beartype._check.convert.convsanify` sanifiers after

    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    Returns
    -------
    HintSane
        **Sanified type hint metadata** (i.e., :class:`.HintSane` object)
        describing this reduction.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484TypeVarViolation
        If one of these type hints violates the bounds or constraints of one of

    #recursively type-checking recursive hints. However, doing so is *EXTREMELY*

    #
    #Non-triviality is one obvious concern. For each recursive hint, @beartype
    #must now:
    #* Dynamically generate one low-level recursive type-checking function
    #  unique to that recursive hint.
    #* Call each such function in higher-level wrapper functions to type-check
    #  each pith against the corresponding recursive hint.
    #
    #Safety is another obvious concern. Generated code *MUST* explicitly guard
    #against infinitely recursive containers:
    #    >>> infinite_list = []
    #    >>> infinite_list.append(infinite_list)  # <-- gg fam
    #
    #But guarding against infinitely recursive containers requires maintaining a

    #Maintaining these frozen sets then incurs a probably significant space and

'''
Value of the optional ``hint_recursable_depth_max`` parameter passed to the
:func:`.is_hint_recursive` tester by the :pep:`695`-compliant reducers defined
above.

This depth ensures that :pep:`695`-compliant type aliases are considered to be
recursive *only* after having been recursed into at most this many times before
(i.e., *only* after having been visited exactly twice, once as a parent alias
and again as a transitive child hint of this parent alias). :pep:`695`-compliant
type aliases typically describe non-trivial recursive data structures conveying
internal semantics that merit deeper recursion. This depth guarantees that.

Consider the following :pep:`695`-compliant subscripted type alias:

.. code-block:: python

   type RecursiveList[T] = list[RecursiveList[T] | T]

Lists satisfying the concrete type alias ``RecursiveList[int]`` contain an
arbitrary number of integers and other lists containing an arbitrary number of
integers, exhibiting this internal structure:

.. code-block:: python

   [42, [79]]
   [42, [79], 83]
   [42, [79], 83, [56, 12]]

Halting recursion at the first expansion of the concrete type alias
``RecursiveList[int]`` to ``list[RecursiveList[int] | int]`` would then reduce
the latter to ``list[HINT_SANE_RECURSIVE | int]``, which reduces to
``list[HINT_SANE_RECURSIVE]``, which reduces to :class:`list`, which clearly
fails to convey the internal semantics of this data structure.

Halting recursion at the second expansion of the concrete type alias
``RecursiveList[int]`` to ``list[RecursiveList[int] | int]`` instead reduces the
latter to ``list[list[RecursiveList[int] | int] | int]``, which reduces to
``list[list[HINT_SANE_RECURSIVE | int] | int]``, reducing to
``list[list[HINT_SANE_RECURSIVE] | int]``, which reduces to ``list[list |
int]`` -- conveying exactly one layer of the internal semantics of this
recursive data structure.
