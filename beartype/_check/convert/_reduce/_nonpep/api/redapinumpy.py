Project-wide **PEP-noncompliant NumPy type hint reducers** (i.e., low-level
callables converting higher-level type hints defined by the third-party
:mod:`numpy` package that do *not* comply with any specific PEP but are
nonetheless shallowly supported by :mod:`beartype` to lower-level type hints
more readily consumable by :mod:`beartype`).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

# optional libraries, both because those libraries cannot be guaranteed to be

def reduce_hint_numpy_ndarray(hint: Hint, exception_prefix: str) -> Hint:
    '''
    Reduce the passed **PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array** (i.e.,
    subscription of the third-party :attr:`numpy.typing.NDArray` type hint
    factory) to the equivalent PEP-compliant beartype validator validating
    arbitrary objects be instances of that array type -- which has the
    substantial merit of already being well-supported, well-tested, and
    well-known to generate optimally efficient type-checking by the
    :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

    Technically, beartype could instead explicitly handle typed NumPy arrays
    throughout the codebase. Of course, doing so would yield *no* tangible
    benefits while imposing a considerable maintenance burden.

    This reducer is memoized for efficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        This PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array reduced to a PEP-compliant type
        hint supported by :mod:`beartype`.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepNumpyException
        If this hint is a typed NumPy array but either:

        * *Not* subscripted by exactly two arguments.
        * Subscripted by exactly two arguments but whose second argument is
          neither:

          * A **NumPy data type** (i.e., :class:`numpy.dtype` instance).
          * An object coercible into a NumPy data type by passing to the
            :meth:`numpy.dtype.__init__` method.

    # adding "HintSignNumpyArray" to the "HINT_SIGNS_ORIGIN_ISINSTANCEABLE"
    # frozen set of all signs whose unsubscripted type hint factories are
    # shallowly type-checkable). Why? Because the "NDArray" type hint factory

    # subscripts *AND* parametrizes itself with the "numpy.ScalarType" type
    # variable bounded above by the "numpy.generic" abstract base class for
    # NumPy scalars.
    #
    # We have *NO* idea why NumPy does this. This implicit behaviour is
    # semantically lossy rather than lossless and thus arguably constitutes an
    # upstream bug. Why? Because this behaviour violates:
    # * The NumPy API. The "NDArray" type hint factory is subscriptable by more
    #   than merely NumPy scalar types. Ergo, "NDArray" is semantically
    #   inaccurate!
    # * PEP 484, which explicitly standardizes an equivalence between
    #   unsubscripted type hint factories and the same factories subscripted by
    #   the "typing.Any" singleton. However, "NDArray" is *MUCH* semantically
    #   narrower than and thus *NOT* equivalent to "NDArray[Any]"!
