Beartype **PEP-agnostic type hint coercers** (i.e., mid-level callables
*permanently* converting type hints from one format into another, either
losslessly or in a lossy manner).

Type hint coercions imposed by this submodule are externalized outside
:mod:`beartype` as globally scoped changes accessible to other modules. These
coercions are permanently applied to the ``__annotations__`` dunder dictionaries
of the classes and callables annotated by these type hints.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: [PEP 544] coerce_hint() should also coerce PEP 544-compatible protocols
#*NOT* decorated by @typing.runtime_checkable to be decorated by that decorator,
#as such protocols are unusable at runtime. Yes, we should always try something
#*REALLY* sneaky and clever.
#
#Specifically, rather than accept "typing" nonsense verbatim, we could instead:
#* Detect PEP 544-compatible protocol type hints *NOT* decorated by
#  @typing.runtime_checkable. The existing is_type_isinstanceable() tester now
#  detects whether arbitrary classes are isinstanceable, so just call that.
#* Emit a non-fatal warning advising the end user to resolve this on their end.
#* Meanwhile, beartype can simply:
#  * Dynamically fabricate a new PEP 544-compatible protocol decorated by
#    @typing.runtime_checkable using the body of the undecorated user-defined
#    protocol as its base. Indeed, simply subclassing a new subclass decorated
#    by @typing.runtime_checkable from the undecorated user-defined protocol as
#    its base with a noop body of "pass" should suffice.
#  * Replacing all instances of the undecorated user-defined protocol with that
#    decorated beartype-defined protocol in annotations. Note this would
#    strongly benefit from some form of memoization or caching. Since this edge
#    case should be fairly rare, even a dictionary would probably be overkill.
#    Just implementing something resembling the following memoized getter
#    in the "utilpep544" submodule would probably suffice:
#        @callable_cached
#        def get_pep544_protocol_checkable_from_protocol_uncheckable(
#            protocol_uncheckable: object) -> Protocol:
#            ...
#
#Checkmate, "typing". Checkmate.

    '''
    PEP-compliant type hint coerced (i.e., converted) from the passed **root
    type hint** (i.e., possibly PEP-noncompliant type hint annotating the
    parameter or return with the passed name of the passed callable) if this
    hint is coercible *or* this hint as is otherwise (i.e., if this hint is
    *not* coercible).

    This function is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the

    Caveats
    -------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Since this high-level function
    internally defers to unmemoized low-level functions that are :math:`O(n)`
    for :math:``n` the size of the inheritance hierarchy of this hint, this
    function should be called sparingly. See the
    :mod:`beartype._decor.cache.cachehint` submodule for further details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Possibly PEP-noncompliant type hint to be possibly coerced.
    decor_meta : BeartypeDecorMeta
        Decorated callable directly annotated by this hint.

        * If this hint annotates a parameter of some callable, the name of that
          parameter.
        * If this hint annotates the return of some callable, ``"return"``.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing raised exception messages.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        Either:

        * If this possibly PEP-noncompliant hint is coercible, a PEP-compliant
          type hint coerced from this hint.

def coerce_hint_any(hint: Hint) -> Hint:
    '''
    PEP-compliant type hint coerced (i.e., converted) from the passed
    PEP-compliant type hint if this hint is coercible *or* this hint as is
    otherwise (i.e., if this hint is *not* coercible).

    Specifically, if the passed hint is:

    * A **PEP-compliant uncached type hint** (i.e., hint *not* already

      * If this hint has already been passed to a prior call of this function,

        same machine-readable representation as this hint cached by that call.
        Doing so deduplicates this hint, which both:

        * Minimizes space complexity across the lifetime of this process.
        * Minimizes time complexity by enabling beartype-specific memoized

      Uncached hints include:

        ``from typing import List; class MuhPep484List(List): pass;
        MuhPep484List[int]``). See below for further commentary.

        * Builtin :pep:`585`-compliant type hints (e.g., ``list[int]``).
        * User-defined :pep:`585`-compliant generics (e.g.,
          ``class MuhPep585List(list): pass; MuhPep585List[int]``).

    * Already cached, this hint is already PEP-compliant by definition. In this
      case, this function preserves and returns this hint as is.

    This function is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator). See caveats that follow.

    Design
    ------
    This function does *not* bother caching **self-caching type hints** (i.e.,
    type hints that externally cache themselves), as these hints are already
    cached elsewhere. Self-cached type hints include most type hints created by
    subscripting type hint factories declared by the :mod:`typing` module,
    which internally cache their resulting type hints: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> import typing
       >>> typing.List[int] is typing.List[int]
       True

    Equivalently, this function *only* caches **uncached type hints** (i.e.,
    type hints that do *not* externally cache themselves), as these hints are
    *not* already cached elsewhere. Uncached type hints include *all*
    :pep:`585`-compliant type hints produced by subscripting builtin container
    types, which fail to internally cache their resulting type hints: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> list[int] is list[int]
       False

    This function enables callers to coerce uncached type hints into
    :mod:`beartype`-cached type hints. :mod:`beartype` effectively requires
    *all* type hints to be cached somewhere! :mod:`beartype` does *not* care
    who, what, or how is caching those type hints -- only that they are cached
    before being passed to utility functions in the :mod:`beartype` codebase.
    Why? Because most such utility functions are memoized for efficiency by the
    :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached` decorator, which
    maps passed parameters (typically including the standard ``hint`` parameter
    accepting a type hint) based on object identity to previously cached return
    values. You see the problem, we trust.

    Uncached type hints that are otherwise semantically equal are nonetheless
    distinct objects and will thus be treated as distinct parameters by
    memoization decorators. If this function did *not* exist, uncached type
    hints could *not* be coerced into :mod:`beartype`-cached type hints and
    thus could *not* be memoized, dramatically reducing the efficiency of
    :mod:`beartype` for standard type hints.

    Caveats
    -------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Since this high-level function
    internally defers to unmemoized low-level functions that are :math:`O(n)`
    for :math:`n` the size of the inheritance hierarchy of this hint, this
    function should be called sparingly.

    This function intentionally does *not* cache :pep:`484`-compliant generics
    subscripted by type variables under Python < 3.9. Those hints are
    technically uncached but silently treated by this function as self-cached
    and thus preserved as is. Why? Because correctly detecting those hints as
    uncached would require an unmemoized :math:`O(n)` search across the
    inheritance hierarchy of *all* passed objects and thus all type hints
    annotating callables decorated by :func:`beartype.beartype`. Since this
    failure only affects obsolete Python versions *and* since the only harms
    induced by this failure are a slight increase in space and time consumption
    for edge-case type hints unlikely to actually be used in real-world code,
    this tradeoff is more than acceptable. We're not the bad guy here. Right?

**Type hint cache** (i.e., thread-safe cache mapping from the machine-readable
representations of all non-self-cached type hints to cached singleton instances
of those hints).**

This cache caches:

* :pep:`585`-compliant type hints, which do *not* cache themselves.
* :pep:`604`-compliant unions, which do *not* cache themselves.

This cache does *not* cache:

* Type hints declared by the :mod:`typing` module, which implicitly cache
  themselves on subscription thanks to inscrutable metaclass magic.
* :pep:`563`-compliant **deferred type hints** (i.e., type hints persisted as
  evaluable strings rather than actual type hints). Ideally, this cache would
  cache the evaluations of *all* deferred type hints. Sadly, doing so is
  infeasible in the general case due to global and local namespace lookups
  (e.g., ``Dict[str, int]`` only means what you think it means if an
  importation resembling ``from typing import Dict`` preceded that type hint).

Design
------
**This dictionary is intentionally thread-safe.** Why? Because this dictionary
is used to modify the ``__attributes__`` dunder variable of arbitrary callables.
Since most such callables are either module- or class-scoped, that variable is
effectively global. To prevent race conditions between competing threads
contending over that variable, this dictionary *must* be thread-safe.

**This dictionary is intentionally designed as a naive dictionary rather than a
robust LRU cache,** for the same reasons that callables accepting hints are
memoized by the :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached`
rather than the :func:`functools.lru_cache` decorator. Why? Because:

* The number of different type hints instantiated across even worst-case
  codebases is negligible in comparison to the space consumed by those hints.
* The :attr:`sys.modules` dictionary persists strong references to all
  callables declared by previously imported modules. In turn, the
  ``func.__annotations__`` dunder dictionary of each such callable persists
  strong references to all type hints annotating that callable. In turn, these
  two statements imply that type hints are *never* garbage collected but
  instead persisted for the lifetime of the active Python process. Ergo,
  temporarily caching hints in an LRU cache is pointless, as there are *no*
  space savings in dropping stale references to unused hints.

**This dictionary intentionally caches machine-readable representation strings
hashes rather than alternative keys** (e.g., actual hashes). Why? Disambiguity.
Although comparatively less efficient in both space and time to construct than
hashes, the :func:`repr` strings produced for two dissimilar type hints *never*
ambiguously collide unless an external caller maliciously modified one or more
identifying dunder attributes of those hints (e.g., the ``__module__``,
``__qualname__``, and/or ``__name__`` dunder attributes). That should *never*
occur in production code. Meanwhile, the :func:`hash` values produced for two
dissimilar type hints *commonly* ambiguously collide. This is why hashable
containers (e.g., :class:`dict`, :class:`set`) explicitly handle hash table
collisions and why we are *not* going to do so.
