'''
Project-wide **PEP-agnostic type hint reducers** (i.e., low-level callables
*temporarily* converting type hints from one format into another, either
losslessly or in a lossy manner).

Type hint reductions imposed by this submodule are purely internal to
:mod:`beartype` itself and thus transient in nature. These reductions are *not*
permanently applied to the ``__annotations__`` dunder dictionaries of the
classes and callables annotated by these type hints.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

    Lower-level type hint reduced (i.e., converted) from the passed higher-level
    type hint if this hint is reducible *or* this hint as is otherwise (i.e., if
    this hint is irreducible).

    This reducer *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since multiple passed
    parameters (e.g., ``pith_name``, ``cls_stack``) are typically isolated to a
    handful of callables across the codebase currently being decorated by
    :mod:`beartype`. Memoizing this reducer would needlessly consume space and
    time. To improve efficiency, this reducer is instead implemented in terms of
    two lower-level private reducers:

    * The memoized :func:`._reduce_hint_cached` reducer, responsible for
      efficiently reducing *most* (but not all) type hints.
    * The unmemoized :func:`._reduce_hint_uncached` reducer, responsible for
      inefficiently reducing the small subset of type hints contextually
      requiring these problematic parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Any
        Type hint to be possibly reduced.
    conf : BeartypeConf
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all settings configuring type-checking for the passed object).
    decor_meta : Optional[BeartypeDecorMeta], optional
        Either:

        * If this hint annotates a parameter or return of some callable, the
          :mod:`beartype`-specific decorator metadata describing that callable.
        * Else, :data:`None`.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    pith_name : Optional[str], optional
        Either:

        * If this hint annotates a parameter of some callable, the name of that
          parameter.
        * If this hint annotates the return of some callable, ``"return"``.
        * Else, :data:`None`.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    arg_kind : Optional[ArgKind]
        Either:

        * If this hint annotates a parameter of some callable, that parameter's
          **kind** (i.e., :class:`.ArgKind` enumeration member conveying the
          syntactic class of that parameter, constraining how the callable
          declaring that parameter requires that parameter to be passed).
        * Else, :data:`None`.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    cls_stack : TypeStack, optional
        **Type stack** (i.e., either a tuple of the one or more
        :func:`beartype.beartype`-decorated classes lexically containing the
        class variable or method annotated by this hint *or* :data:`None`).
        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing exception messages raised by this
        reducer. Defaults to the empty string.

    Returns
    -------

Dictionary mapping from each sign uniquely identifying PEP-compliant type hints
to that sign's **cached reducer** (i.e., low-level function efficiently memoized
by the :func:`.callable_cached` decorator reducing those higher- to lower-level
hints).

Each value of this dictionary is expected to have a signature resembling:

.. code-block:: python

   def reduce_hint_pep{pep_number}(
       hint: object,
       conf: BeartypeConf,
       pith_name: Optional[str],
       exception_prefix: str,
       *args, **kwargs
   ) -> object:

Note that:

* Reducers should explicitly accept *only* those parameters they explicitly
  require. Ergo, a reducer requiring *only* the ``hint`` parameter should omit
  all of the other parameters referenced above.
* Reducers do *not* need to validate the passed type hint as being of the
  expected sign. By design, a reducer is only ever passed a type hint of the
  expected sign.
* Reducers should *not* be memoized (e.g., by the
  ``callable_cached`` decorator). Since the higher-level :func:`.reduce_hint`
  function that is the sole entry point to calling all lower-level reducers is
  itself memoized, reducers themselves neither require nor benefit from
  memoization. Moreover, even if they did either require or benefit from
  memoization, they couldn't be -- at least, not directly. Why? Because
  :func:`.reduce_hint` necessarily passes keyword arguments to all reducers. But
  memoized functions *cannot* receive keyword arguments (without destroying
  efficiency and thus the entire point of memoization).
