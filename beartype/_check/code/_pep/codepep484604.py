    '''
    Either a Python code snippet type-checking the current pith against the
    passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`604`-compliant union type hint if this union is
    **unignorable** (i.e., subscripted by *no* ignorable child type hints) *or*
    :data:`None` otherwise (i.e., if this union is ignorable).

    This factory is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`.callable_cached` decorator), due to accepting **context-sensitive
    parameters** (i.e., whose values contextually depend on context unique to
    the code being generated for the currently decorated callable) such as
    ``pith_curr_assign_expr``.

    Caveats
    -------
    Unions are non-physical abstractions of physical types and thus *not*
    themselves subject to type-checking; only the subscripted arguments of
    unions are type-checked. This differs from :mod:`typing` pseudo-containers
    like ``List[int]``, in which both the parent :obj:`typing.List` and child
    :class:`int` types represent physical types to be type-checked. Ergo, unions
    themselves impose no narrowing of the current pith expression and thus
    *cannot* by definition benefit from assignment expressions. This differs
    from :mod:`typing` pseudo-containers, which narrow the current pith
    expression and thus do benefit from assignment expressions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hints_meta : HintsMeta

        this breadth-first search (BFS).

    # a set would be preferable for simplicity, the fact that sets are currently
    # unordered leaves us no choice but to abuse dictionaries.
    #
    # The order of union child hints is insignificant in the common case but
    # *NOT* the worst case, where order is significant. Examples include:
    # * A union over classes whose metaclasses define custom type-checking by
    #   overriding the __instancecheck__() dunder method. Callers might
    #   intentionally order those classes in that union to maximize
    #   type-checking efficiency. How? In descending order of the efficiency of
    #   those __instancecheck__() implementations. The most efficiently
    #   type-checkable classes would be listed first in that union; the least
    #   efficiently type-checkable classes, last.
    # * A union over classes registered as pseudo-subclasses with the
    #   collections.abc.ABCMeta.register() method. Callers might intentionally
    #   order those classes in that union to prevent type-checking code
    #   dynamically generated by beartype from raising unexpected exceptions in
    #   the event that those classes fail to fully satisfy the API of the ABC
    #   they were registered with. See also this issue:

    # Since PEP-compliant and -noncompliant child hints require fundamentally

        #
        #There's absolutely *NO* way that's hashable. We... kinda messed up

        #This suggests that nearly all type hints of real-world interest are

        #        hint_childs_nonpep[hint_child] = None  # type: ignore[index]
        #
        #As the above logic suggests, this edge case *ONLY* applies to
        #PEP-compliant type hints. All PEP-noncompliant type hints are
        #isinstanceable types -- which, by definition, are all hashable. \o/
        #
        #Naturally, we'll then need to:
        #* Rename "hint_childs_sane_pep" to "hint_childs_sane_pep_hashable".
        #* Define "hint_childs_sane_pep_unhashable" as a list above.

def _get_hint_pep484604_union_args_flattened(
    hints_meta: HintsMeta) -> TupleHintSane:
    '''
    Flattened tuple of the two or more child hints subscripting the passed
    :pep:`604`- or :pep:`484`-compliant union hint such that *all* nested child
    hints subscripting *all* child union hints are **flattened** (i.e., expanded
    directly) into the returned tuple, thus non-destructively eliminating *all*
    child union hints of this parent union hint.

    This getter recursively flattens arbitrarily nested child union hints
    regardless of nesting depth in this parent union hint. Although non-trivial,
    doing so is required to support uncommon edge cases -- including:

    * :`pep:`695`-compliant type aliases, which technically enable users to
      deeply nest type aliases and thus unions to an arbitrarily deep nesting
      level: e.g.,

      .. code-block:: python

         # After reduction, the PEP 695-compliant "Level3" type alias defined
         # below effectively resembles:
         #     type Level3 = ((int | complex) | str) | float
         type Level1 = int | complex
         type Level2 = Level1 | str
         type Level3 = Level2 | float

    This getter is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`.callable_cached` decorator), as the only function calling this
    getter *is* itself memoized.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This getter exhibits time complexity** :math:`O(k)` **for k the total
    number of all transitive child hints of this union hint across all deeply
    nested child unions of this parent union hint.** A looser bound but somewhat
    more intelligible upper complexity bound would be :math:`O(n**m)`, where:

    * :m.th:`n` is the maximum number of child hints in any deeply nested child
      union of this parent union hint.
    * :math:`m` is the maximum depth of the most deeply nested child union of
      this parent union hint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hints_meta : HintsMeta
        **Type hint type-checking metadata queue** (i.e., low-level fixed list
        of metadata describing all visitable type hints currently discovered by

        type-checking code snippets in the
        :func:`beartype._check.code.codemake.make_check_expr` factory).

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[HintSane, ...]
        Flattened tuple of the two or more child hints *or* **sanified child

        # Note that this sanification is intentionally performed *BEFORE* the
        # sign of this child hint is tested. Why? Because some reductions expand
        # an arbitrary hint into a union. This includes:
        # * PEP 695-compliant type aliases aliased to unions. See above!
        # * The PEP-noncompliant "float' and "complex" types, implicitly
        #   expanded to the PEP 484-compliant "float | int" and "complex | float
        #   | int" type hints (respectively) when the non-default

        # * User-defined "hint_overrides", a generalization of the prior item.
        #
        # Likewise, note that this sanification implicitly handles *ALL*
        # recursive edge cases. We need *NOT* do so explicitly above or below.
        # Notably, if this child hint has already been sanified by a previously
        # performed sanification in this recursive tree of all previously
        # performed sanifications, there now exist two divergent edge cases.
        # Either:
        # * This child hint has intrinsic value and *MUST* thus be preserved as
        #   a member of this union. This edge case currently arises *ONLY*
        #   through hint overrides. Consider overriding the child hint "float"
        #   with the PEP 604-compliant union "int | float". In this case:
        #   * The initial sanification of the child hint "float" performed above
        #     will expand that hint to "int | float".
        #   * The unflattening performed below will then append the child hints
        #     "int" and "float" for subsequent iteration by this "while" loop.
        #   * The child hint "float" will then be detected as having been
        #     previously sanified. This child hint *CANNOT* be removed or
        #     ignored, as doing so would omit this child hint from this union.
        #     This child hint thus has intrinsic value and *MUST* thus be
        #     preserved as a member of this union.
        #
        #   This edge case is implicitly handled by the
        #   hints_meta.sanify_hint_child() method called below, which
        #   transitively calls the reduce_hint() function, which detects
        #   recursion in an overridden hint and implicitly returns that hint as
        #   is *WITHOUT* recursively overriding that hint yet again.
        # * This child hint lacks intrinsic value and *MUST* thus be removed as
        #   a member of this union. This edge case currently arises *ONLY*
        #   through PEP 695-compliant recursive type aliases. Consider:
        #       type RecursiveUnion = int | RecursiveUnion
        #
        #   The recursive type alias "RecursiveAlias" merely has symbolic value
        #   and thus lacks intrinsic value. This type alias is semantically
        #   equivalent to the non-recursive type alias:
        #       type NonrecursiveAlias = int
        #
        #   Similar logic as with the prior edge case then applies, except that
        #   this hint *SHOULD* be removed and ignored (rather than preserved).
        #   Thankfully, this edge case as well is implicitly handled by the
        #   hints_meta.sanify_hint_child() method called below, which
        #   transitively calls the reduce_hint() function, which detects
        #   recursion in a non-overridden hint and explicitly returns
