    '''
    **Type-checking expression factory** (i.e., low-level callable dynamically
    generating a pure-Python boolean expression type-checking an arbitrary
    object against the passed PEP-compliant type hint).

    This code factory performs a breadth-first search (BFS) over the abstract
    graph of nested type hints reachable from the subscripted arguments of the
    passed root type hint. For each such (possibly nested) hint, this factory
    embeds one or more boolean subexpressions validating a (possibly nested
    sub)object of an arbitrary object against that hint into the full boolean
    expression created and returned by this factory. In short, this factory is
    the beating heart of :mod:`beartype`. We applaud you for your perseverance.
    You finally found the essence of the Great Bear. You did it!! Now, we clap.

    This code factory is memoized for efficiency.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This factory intentionally accepts no** ``exception_prefix``
    **parameter.** Why? Since that parameter is typically specific to the
    context-sensitive use case of the caller, accepting that parameter would
    prevent this factory from memoizing the passed hint with the returned code,
    which would rather defeat the point. Instead, this factory only:

    * Returns generic non-working code containing the placeholder
      :data:`VAR_NAME_PITH_ROOT` substring that the caller is required to
      globally replace by either the name of the current parameter *or*
      ``return`` for return values (e.g., by calling the builtin
      :meth:`str.replace` method) to generate the desired non-generic working
      code type-checking that parameter or return value.
    * Raises generic non-human-readable exceptions containing the placeholder
      :attr:`beartype._util.error.utilerrraise.EXCEPTION_PLACEHOLDER` substring
      that the caller is required to explicitly catch and raise non-generic
      human-readable exceptions from by calling the
      :func:`beartype._util.error.utilerrraise.reraise_exception_placeholder`
      function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        PEP-compliant type hint to be type-checked.
    conf : BeartypeConf
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all settings configuring type-checking for the passed object).
    cls_stack : TypeStack, optional
        **Type stack** (i.e., either a tuple of the one or more
        :func:`beartype.beartype`-decorated classes lexically containing the
        class variable or method annotated by this hint *or* :data:`None`).
        Defaults to :data:`None`.

    Returns
    -------
    CodeGenerated
        Tuple containing the Python code snippet dynamically generated by this
        code generator and metadata describing that code. See the
        :attr:`beartype._data.hint.datahinttyping.CodeGenerated` type hint for details.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPepException
        If this object is *not* a PEP-compliant type hint.
    BeartypeDecorHintPepUnsupportedException
        If this object is a PEP-compliant type hint currently unsupported by
        the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484Exception
        If one or more PEP-compliant type hints visitable from this object are
        nested :attr:`typing.NoReturn` child hints, since
        :attr:`typing.NoReturn` is valid *only* as a non-nested return hint.
    BeartypeDecorHintPep593Exception
        If one or more PEP-compliant type hints visitable from this object
        subscript the :pep:`593`-compliant :class:`typing.Annotated` class such
        that:

        * The second argument subscripting that class is an instance of the
          :class:`beartype.vale.Is` class.
        * One or more further arguments subscripting that class are *not*
          instances of the :class:`beartype.vale.Is` class.

    Warns
    -----
    BeartypeDecorHintPep585DeprecationWarning
        If one or more :pep:`484`-compliant type hints visitable from this
        object have been deprecated by :pep:`585`.

            # * A discrete private function called by this function. This
            #   approach requires maintaining a global private dictionary
            #   mapping from each support unsubscripted typing attribute to
            #   the function generating code for that attribute: e.g.,
            #      def pep_code_check_union(...): ...

            #   Each iteration of this loop then looks up the function
            #   generating code for the current attribute from this dictionary
            #   and calls that function to do so. Function calls come with
            #   substantial overhead in Python, impacting performance more
            #   than the comparable linear series of tests implemented below.
            #   Additionally, these functions *MUST* mutate local variables of
            #   this function by some arcane means -- either:
            #   * Passing these locals to each such function, returning these
            #     locals from each such function, and assigning these return
            #     values to these locals in this function after each such call.
            #   * Passing a single composite fixed list of these locals to each
            #     such function, which then mutates these locals in-place,
            #     which then necessitates this function permanently store these
            #     locals in such a list rather than as local variables.
            # * A discrete closure of this function, which adequately resolves
            #   the aforementioned locality issue via the "nonlocal" keyword at
            #   a substantial up-front performance cost of redeclaring these
