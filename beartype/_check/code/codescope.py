# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Hah-hah! Finally figured out how to do recursive type hints... mostly.
#It's a two-parter consisting of:
#* *PART I.* In the first part:
#  * Refactor our code generation algorithm to additionally maintain a stack of
#    all parent type hints of the currently visited type hint. Note that we need
#    to do this anyway to support the __beartype_hint__() protocol. See "FIXME:"
#    comments in the "beartype.plug._plughintable" submodule pertaining to that
#    protocol for further details on properly building out this stack.
#  * When that algorithm visits a forward reference:
#    * That algorithm calls the express_func_scope_type_ref() function
#      generating type-checking code for that reference. Refactor that call to
#      additionally pass that stack of parent hints to that function.
#    * Refactor the express_func_scope_type_ref() function to:
#      * If the passed forward reference is relative, additionally return that
#        stack in the returned 3-tuple
#        "(forwardref_expr, refs_type_basename, forwardref_parent_hints)",
#        where "forwardref_parent_hints" is that stack.
#* *PART II.* In the second part:
#  * Refactor the beartype._decor.wrap.wrapmain._unmemoize_func_wrapper_code()
#    function to additionally:
#    * If the passed forward reference is relative *AND* the unqualified
#      basename of an existing attribute in a local or global scope of the
#      currently decorated callable *AND* the value of that attribute is a
#      parent type hint on the stack of parent type hints returned by the
#      previously called express_func_scope_type_ref() function, then
#      *THIS REFERENCE INDICATES A RECURSIVE TYPE HINT.* In this case:
#      * Replace this forward reference with a new recursive type-checking
#        "beartype._check.forward.reference.fwdrefabc.BeartypeForwardRef_{forwardref}"
#        subclass whose is_instance() tester method recursively calls itself
#        indefinitely. If doing so generates a "RecursionError", @beartype
#        considers that the user's problem. *wink*
#      * Note that this is_instance() tester method should guard itself against
#        recursion by accepting an optional "obj_ids: FrozenSetInts =
#        FROZEN_SET_EMPTY" parameter recording the IDs of all previously tested
#        objects. Consider infinite containers: e.g.,
#            infinite_list = []
#            infinite_list.append(infinite_list)
#
#Done and done. Phew!

    Parameters
    ----------
    func_scope : LexicalScope
        Local or global scope to add this object to.
    types : SetOrTupleOfTypes
        Set or tuple of arbitrary types to be added to this scope.
    is_unique : Optional[bool]
        Tri-state boolean governing whether this function attempts to
        deduplicate types in the ``types`` iterable. Specifically, either:

        * :data:`True`, in which case the caller guarantees ``types`` to contain
          *no* duplicate types.
        * :data:`False`, in which case this function assumes ``types`` to
          contain duplicate types by internally (in order):

          #. Coercing this tuple into a set, thus implicitly ignoring both
             duplicates and ordering of types in this tuple.
          #. Coercing that set back into another tuple.
          #. If these two tuples differ, the passed tuple contains one or more
             duplicates; in this case, the duplicate-free tuple is cached and
             passed.
          #. Else, the passed tuple contains no duplicates; in this case, the
             passed tuple is cached and passed.

        * :data:`None`, in which case this function reduces this parameter to
          either:

          * :data:`True` if ``types`` is a :class:`tuple`.
          * :data:`False` if ``types`` is a :class:`set`.

        This tri-state boolean does *not* simply enable an edge-case
        optimization, though it certainly does that; this boolean enables
        callers to guarantee that this function caches and passes the passed
        tuple rather than a new tuple internally created by this function.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message. Defaults to a sensible string.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        Name of this tuple in this scope generated by this function.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepException
        If this hint is either:

    '''
    Express the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant **forward reference**
    (i.e., fully-qualified or unqualified name of an arbitrary class that
    typically has yet to be declared) as a Python expression evaluating to this
    forward reference when accessed via the beartypistry singleton added as a
    new key-value pair of the passed dictionary, whose key is the string
    :attr:`beartype._check.checkmagic.ARG_NAME_TYPISTRY` and whose value is the
    beartypistry singleton.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func_scope : LexicalScope
        Local or global scope to add this forward reference to.
    forwardref : Pep484585ForwardRef
        Forward reference to be expressed relative to this scope.
    refs_type_basename : Optional[set]
        Set of all existing **relative forward references** (i.e., unqualified
        basenames of all types referred to by all relative forward references
        relative to this scope) if any *or* :data:`None` otherwise (i.e., if no
        relative forward references have been expressed relative to this scope).
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages. Defaults
        to a sensible string.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[str, Optional[set]]
        2-tuple ``(forwardref_expr, refs_type_basename)``, where:

        * ``forwardref_expr`` is the Python expression evaluating to this
          forward reference when accessed via the beartypistry singleton added
          to this scope.
        * ``refs_type_basename`` is either:

          * If this forward reference is a fully-qualified classname, the
            passed ``refs_type_basename`` set as is.
          * If this forward reference is an unqualified classname, either:

            * If the passed ``refs_type_basename`` set is *not* :data:`None`,
              this set with this classname added to it.
            * Else, a new set containing only this classname.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintForwardRefException
        If this forward reference is *not* actually a forward reference.

'''
**Tuple union cache** (i.e., dictionary mapping from each tuple union passed to
the :func:`.add_func_scope_types` adder to that same union, preventing tuple
unions from being duplicated across calls to that adder).

This cache serves a dual purpose. Notably, this cache both enables:

* External callers to iterate over all previously instantiated forward reference
  proxies. This is particularly useful when responding to module reloading,
  which requires that *all* previously cached types be uncached.
* A minor reduction in space complexity by de-duplicating duplicating tuple
  unions. Since the existing ``callable_cached`` decorator could trivially do so
  as well, however, this is only a negligible side effect.
