#FIXME: This refactoring has yet another profound benefit. What? We can
#precompute the values of "pith_curr_var_name" at "HintMeta" instantiation time.
#Since that string *NEVER* changes, just assign each ""pith_curr_var_name"

class HintMeta(object):
    '''
    **Type hint type-checking metadata** (i.e., low-level dataclass storing
    metadata describing the possibly nested type hint visited by the current
    iteration of the breadth-first search (BFS) dynamically generating
    pure-Python type-checking code snippets in the
    :func:`beartype._check.code.codemake.make_check_expr` factory).

    Attributes
    ----------
    hint : object
        Type hint currently visited by this BFS.
    hint_placeholder : str
        **Type-checking placeholder substring** to be globally replaced in the
        **type-checking wrapper function code snippet** (i.e., the
        ``func_wrapper_code`` local defined by the
        :func:`beartype._check.code.codemake.make_check_expr` factory) by a
        Python code snippet type-checking the **current pith expression** (i.e.,
        the ``pith_var_name`` local) against the **currently visited type hint**
        (i.e., the :attr:`hint` instance variable).

        This substring provides indirection enabling the currently visited
        parent hint to defer and delegate the generation of code type-checking
        each child type hint of this parent hint to the subsequent time at which
        that child type hint is visited by that BFS.

        This substring is intentionally prefixed and suffixed by characters
        that:

        * Are intentionally invalid as Python code, guaranteeing that the
          top-level call to the func:`exec` builtin subsequently performed by
          the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator will raise a
          :exc:`SyntaxError` exception if the caller failed to replace *all*
          placeholder substrings.
        * Protect the :attr:`pith_var_name_index` integer embedded in this
          substring against ambiguous global replacements of longer such
          integers containing this integer (e.g., the integer 1, contained in
          the longer integers 11 and 21). If this integer were *not* protected
          in this manner, then the first substring ``"0"`` would ambiguously
          overlap with the subsequent substring ``"10"``, which would then
          produce catastrophically erroneous and undebuggable Python code.

    Example
    ------
        For example, the
        :func:`beartype._check.code.codemake.make_check_expr` factory might
        generate intermediary code resembling the following on visiting the
        :obj:`typing.Union` parent type hint of a subscripted ``Union[int,
        str]`` type hint *before* visiting either the :class:`int` or
        :class:`str` child type hints of that parent type hint:

        .. code-block:: python

           if not (
               @{0}! or
               @{1}!
           ):
               raise get_func_pith_violation(
                   func=__beartype_func,
                   pith_name=$%PITH_ROOT_NAME/~,
                   pith_value=__beartype_pith_root,
               )

        Note the unique substrings ``"@{0}!"`` and ``"@{1}!"`` in that code,
        which that factory iteratively replaces with code type-checking each of
        the child type hints (e.g., :class:`int`, :class:`str`) subscripting
        that :obj:`typing.Union` parent type hint. The final code memoized by
        that factory might then resemble:

        .. code-block:: python

           if not (
               isinstance(__beartype_pith_root, int) or
               isinstance(__beartype_pith_root, str)
           ):
               raise get_func_pith_violation(
                   func=__beartype_func,
                   pith_name=$%PITH_ROOT_NAME/~,
                   pith_value=__beartype_pith_root,
               )
    pith_expr : str
        **Pith expression** (i.e., Python code snippet evaluating to the value
        of) the current **pith** (i.e., possibly nested object of the passed
        parameter or return to be type-checked against the currently visited
        type hint).

        Note that this expression is intentionally *not* an assignment
        expression but rather the original inefficient expression provided by
        the parent type hint of the currently visited type hint.
    pith_var_name_index : int
        **Pith variable name index** (i.e., 0-based integer suffixing the name
        of each local variable assigned the value of the current pith in a
        assignment expression, thus uniquifying this variable in the body of the
        current wrapper function). Indexing the
        :obj:`beartype._check.code.snip.codesnipcls.PITH_INDEX_TO_VAR_NAME`
        dictionary singleton by this integer efficiently yields the current
        **pith variable name** locally storing the value of the current pith.

        Note that this integer is intentionally incremented as an efficient
        low-level scalar rather than as an inefficient high-level
        :class:`itertools.Counter` object. Since both are equally thread-safe in
        the internal context of a function body, the former is preferable.
    indent_level : int
        **Indentation level** (i.e., 1-based positive integer providing the
        current level of indentation appropriate for the currently visited type
        hint). Indexing the
        :obj:`beartype._data.code.datacodeindent.INDENT_LEVEL_TO_CODE`
        dictionary singleton by this integer efficiently yields the current
        **indendation string** suitable for prefixing each line of code
        type-checking the current pith against the current type hint.

    This list acts as a standard First In First Out (FILO) queue, enabling that

        breadth-first search (BFS) in the
        :func:`beartype._check.code.codemake.make_check_expr` factory.

        For both efficiency and simplicity, this dunder method *always* returns
        a valid :class:`HintMeta` object for all valid indices. This list thus
        behaves similarly to the :class:`collections.defaultdict` container.
        Specifically:

        * If this is the first attempt to access metadata at this index from
          this list (i.e., the value of the item at this index is :data:`None`),
          this dunder method (in order):

          #. Instantiates a new :class:`.HintMeta` object with all fields
             initialized to sane values appropriate for this index.
          #. Replaces the value of the item at this index (which was previously
             :data:`None`) with this new :class:`.HintMeta` object.
          #. Returns new :class:`.HintMeta` object.

        * Else, this is a subsequent access of metadata at this index from this
          list (i.e., the value of the item at this index is an existing
          :class:`.HintMeta` object). In this case, this dunder method simply
          returns that existing :class:`.HintMeta` object as is.

        Parameters
        ----------
        index : int
            0-based absolute index of the type hint type-checking metadata to be
            retrieved, where:

            * Index 0 yields the root type hint currently visited by that BFS.
            * Index 1 yields the first child type hint of that root type hint.
            * And so on.
