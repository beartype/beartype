**Beartype decorator** :pep:`563` **support.**

This private submodule this submodule implements :pep:`563` (i.e., "Postponed
Evaluation of Annotations") support on behalf of the :func:`beartype.beartype`
decorator.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

    '''
    Resolve all :pep:`563`-based **postponed annotations** (i.e., strings that
    when dynamically evaluated as Python expressions yield actual annotations)
    on the currently decorated callable to their **referents** (i.e., the
    actual annotations to which those postponed annotations evaluate) if `PEP
    563`_ is active for this callable *or* silently reduce to a noop otherwise
    (i.e., if :pep:`563` is *not* active for this callable).

    :pep:`563` is active for this callable if the active Python interpreter
    targets either:

    * Python >= 3.7 *and* the module declaring this callable explicitly enables
      :pep:`563` support with a leading dunder importation of the form ``from
      __future__ import annotations``.
    * Python >= ?.?.?, where :pep:`563` is unconditionally globally enabled.

    If :pep:`563` is active for this callable, then for each type-hint
    annotating this callable:

    * If that hint is a string and thus postponed, this function:

      #. Dynamically evaluates that string within this callable's globals
         context (i.e., set of all global variables defined by the module
         declaring this callable).
      #. Replaces that hint's string value with the expression produced by this
         dynamic evaluation.

    * Else, this function preserves that hint as is (e.g., due to that hint
      that was previously postponed having already been evaluated by a prior
      decorator).

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function must be called only directly by the**
    :meth:`beartype._decor._decorcall.BeartypeCall.reinit` **method**, due to
    unavoidably introspecting the current call stack and making fixed
    assumptions about the structure and height of that stack.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bear_call : BeartypeCall
        Decorated callable to be resolved.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep563Exception
        If evaluating a postponed annotation on this callable raises an
        exception (e.g., due to that annotation referring to local state
        inaccessible in this deferred context).

            # decorates the muh_method() method, an attribute of the same name

            # Naively resolving this forward reference would erroneously
            # replace this hint with the previously declared attribute rather
            # than the class currently being declared: e.g.,

            #
            # This isn't simply an edge-case disambiguity, however. This exact
            # situation commonly arises whenever reloading modules containing
            # @beartype-decorated callables annotated with self-references
            # (e.g., by passing those modules to the standard
            # importlib.reload() function). Why? Because module reloading is
            # ill-defined and mostly broken under Python. Since the
            # importlib.reload() function fails to delete any of the attributes
            # of the module to be reloaded before reloading that module, the
            # parent callable or class referred to by this hint will be briefly
            # defined for the duration of @beartype's decoration of this
            # callable as the prior version of that parent callable or class!
            #
            # Resolving this hint would thus superficially succeed, while
            # actually erroneously replacing this hint with the prior rather
            # than current version of that parent callable or class. @beartype
            # would then wrap the decorated callable with a wrapper expecting
            # the prior rather than current version of that parent callable or
            # class. All subsequent calls to that wrapper would then fail.
            # Since this actually happened, we ensure it never does again.
            #
            # Lastly, note that this edge case *ONLY* supports top-level
            # relative forward references (i.e., syntactically valid Python
            # identifier names subscripting *NO* parent type hints). Child
            # relative forward references will continue to raise exceptions. As
            # resolving PEP 563-postponed type hints effectively reduces to a
            # single "all or nothing" call of the low-level eval() builtin
            # accepting *NO* meaningful configuration, there exists *NO* means
            # of only partially resolving parent type hints while preserving
            # relative forward references subscripting those hints. The
            # solution in those cases is for end users to replace implicit with
            # explicit forward references: e.g.,
            #     # Users should replace this implicit forward reference, which
            #     # will fail at runtime...
            #     class MuhClass:
            #         @beartype
            #         def muh_method(self) -> list[MuhClass]: ...
            #
            #     # ...with this explicit forward reference, which will work.
            #     class MuhClass:
            #         @beartype
            #         def muh_method(self) -> list['MuhClass']: ...
            #
            # Indeed, the *ONLY* reasons we support this common edge case are:
            # * This edge case is indeed common.
            # * This edge case is both trivial and efficient to support.
            #

        # provides no means of distinguishing expected from unexpected
        # evaluation of postponed hint, either emitting a non-fatal
        # warning *OR* raising a fatal exception here would be overly violent.

        #
        # * Critically breaks backward compatibility throughout the
        #   well-established Python 3 ecosystem.
        # * Unhelpfully provides no general-purpose API for either:
        #   * Detecting postponed hints on arbitrary objects.
        #   * Resolving those hints.
        # * Dramatically reduces the efficiency of hint-based decorators
        #   for no particularly good reason.
        # * Non-orthogonally prohibits hints from accessing local state.
        #
        # Because we should probably mention those complaints here.

#     '''
#     Raise an exception if the passed machine-readable representation of an
#     arbitrary annotation internally exceeds the **child limit** (i.e., maximum
#     number of nested child type hints listed as subscripted arguments of
#     PEP-compliant type hints) permitted by the :func:`beartype.beartype`
#     decorator.
#
#     The :mod:`beartype` decorator internally traverses over these nested child
#     types of the parent PEP-compliant type hint produced by evaluating this
#     string representation to its referent with a breadth-first search (BFS).
#     For efficiency, this search is iteratively implemented with a cached
#     **fixed list** (i.e.,
#     :class:`beartype._util.cache.pool.utilcachepoollistfixed.FixedList`
#     instance) rather than recursively implemented with traditional recursion.
#     Since the size of this list is sufficiently large to handle all uncommon
#     *and* uncommon edge cases, this list suffices for *all* PEP-compliant type
#     hints of real-world interest.
#
#     Nonetheless, safety demands that we guarantee this by explicitly raising an
#     exception when the internal structure of this string suggests that the
#     resulting PEP-compliant type hint will subsequently violate this limit.
#     This has the convenient side effect of optimizing that BFS, which may now
#     unconditionally insert child hints into arbitrary indices of that cached
#     fixed list without having to explicitly test whether each index exceeds the
#     fixed length of that list.
#
#     Caveats
#     ----------
#     **This function is currently irrelevant.** Why? Because all existing
#     implementations of the :mod:`typing` module are sufficiently
#     space-consumptive that they already implicitly prohibit deep nesting of
#     PEP-compliant type hints. See commentary in the
#     :mod:`beartype_test.a00_unit.data.pep.pep563.data_pep563_poem` submodule for appalling details.
#     Ergo, this validator could technically be disabled. Indeed, if this
#     validator actually incurred any measurable costs, it *would* be disabled.
#     Since it doesn't, this validator has preserved purely for forward
#     compatibility with some future revision of the :mod:`typing` module that
#     hopefully improves that module's horrid space consumption.
#
#     Parameters
#     ----------
#     hint_repr : str
#         Machine-readable representation of this annotation, typically but *not*
#         necessarily as a :pep:`563`-formatted postponed string.
#     pith_label : str
#         Human-readable label describing the callable parameter or return value
#         annotated by this string.
