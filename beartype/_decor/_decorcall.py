class BeartypeCall(object):
    '''
    **Beartype data** (i.e., object aggregating *all* metadata for the callable
    currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).**

    Design
    ----------
    This the *only* object instantiated by that decorator for that callable,
    substantially reducing both space and time costs. That decorator then
    passes this object to most lower-level functions, which then:

    #. Access read-only instance variables of this object as input.
    #. Modify writable instance variables of this object as output. In
       particular, these lower-level functions typically accumulate pure-Python
       code comprising the generated wrapper function type-checking the
       decorated callable by setting various instance variables of this object.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This object cannot be used to communicate state between low-level
    memoized callables** (e.g.,
    :func:`beartype._decor._code._pep._pephint.pep_code_check_hint`) **and
    higher-level callables** (e.g.,
    :func:`beartype._decor._code.codemain.generate_code`). Instead, memoized
    callables *must* return that state as additional return values up the call
    stack to those higher-level callables. By definition, memoized callables
    are *not* recalled on subsequent calls passed the same parameters. Since
    only the first call to those callables passed those parameters would set
    the appropriate state on this object intended to be communicated to
    higher-level callables, *all* subsequent calls would subtly fail with
    difficult-to-diagnose issues. See also `<issue #5_>`__, which exhibited
    this very complaint.

    Attributes
    ----------
    func_arg_name_to_hint : dict[str, object]
        Dictionary mapping from the name of each annotated parameter accepted
        by the decorated callable to the type hint annotating that parameter.
    func_arg_name_to_hint_get : Callable[[str, object], object]
        :meth:`dict.get` method bound to the :attr:`func_arg_name_to_hint`
        dictionary, localized as a negligible microoptimization. Blame Guido.
    func_conf : BeartypeConf
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all flags, options, settings, and other metadata configuring the
        current decoration of the decorated callable).
    func_wrappee : Optional[Callable]
        Possibly wrapped **decorated callable** (i.e., high-level callable
        currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator)
        if the :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise.
        Note the lower-level :attr:`func_wrappee_wrappee` callable should
        *usually* be accessed instead; although higher-level, this callable may
        only be a wrapper function and hence yield inaccurate or even erroneous
        metadata (especially the code object) for the callable being wrapped.
    func_wrappee_codeobj : CodeType
        Possibly wrapped **decorated callable wrappee code object** (i.e.,
        code object underlying the high-level :attr:`func_wrappee` callable
        currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).
        For efficiency, this code object should *always* be accessed in lieu of
        inefficiently calling the comparatively slower
        :func:`beartype._util.func.utilfunccodeobj.get_func_codeobj` getter.
    func_wrappee_wrappee : Optional[Callable]
        Possibly unwrapped **decorated callable wrappee** (i.e., low-level
        callable wrapped by the high-level :attr:`func_wrappee` callable
        currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator)
        if the :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise.
        If the higher-level :attr:`func_wrappee` callable does *not* actually
        wrap another callable, this callable is identical to that callable.
    func_wrappee_wrappee_codeobj : CodeType
        Possibly unwrapped **decorated callable wrappee code object** (i.e.,
        code object underlying the low-level :attr:`func_wrappee_wrappee`
        callable wrapped by the high-level :attr:`func_wrappee` callable
        currently being decorated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).
        For efficiency, this code object should *always* be accessed in lieu of
        inefficiently calling the comparatively slower
        :func:`beartype._util.func.utilfunccodeobj.get_func_codeobj` getter.
    func_wrapper_code_call_prefix : Optional[str]
        Code snippet prefixing all calls to the decorated callable in the body
        of the wrapper function wrapping that callable with type checking if
        the :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise. If
        non-``None``, this string is guaranteed to be either:

        * If the decorated callable is synchronous (i.e., neither a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the empty string.
        * If the decorated callable is asynchronous (i.e., either a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the ``"await "`` keyword.
    func_wrapper_code_signature_prefix : Optional[str]
        Code snippet prefixing the signature declaring the wrapper function
        wrapping the decorated callable with type checking if the
        :meth:`reinit` method has been called *or* ``None`` otherwise. If
        non-``None``, this string is guaranteed to be either:

        * If the decorated callable is synchronous (i.e., neither a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the empty string.
        * If the decorated callable is asynchronous (i.e., either a coroutine
          nor asynchronous generator), the ``"async "`` keyword.
    func_wrapper_locals : CallableScope
        **Local scope** (i.e., dictionary mapping from the name to value of
        each attribute referenced in the signature) of this wrapper function
        required by this code snippet.
    func_wrapper_name : Optional[str]
        Machine-readable name of the wrapper function to be generated and
        returned by this decorator if the :meth:`reinit` method has been called
        *or* ``None`` otherwise. To efficiently (albeit imperfectly) avoid
        clashes with existing attributes of the module defining that function,
        this name is obfuscated while still preserving human-readability.
