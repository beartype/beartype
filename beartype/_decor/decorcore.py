**Unmemoized beartype decorator.**

This private submodule defines all core high-level logic underlying the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator, whose implementation in the parent
:mod:`beartype._decor._cache.cachedecor` submodule is a thin wrapper
efficiently memoizing closures internally created and returned by that
decorator. In turn, those closures directly defer to this submodule.

This private submodule is effectively the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator
despite *not* actually being that decorator (due to being unmemoized).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def beartype_object_safe(

    '''
    Decorate the passed **beartypeable** (i.e., pure-Python callable or class)
    with optimal type-checking dynamically generated unique to that
    beartypeable and any otherwise uncaught exception raised by doing so safely
    coerced into a warning instead.

    Motivation
    ----------
    This decorator is principally intended to be called by our **all-at-once
    API** (i.e., the import hooks defined by the :mod:`beartype.claw`
    subpackage). Raising detailed exception tracebacks on unexpected error
    conditions is:

    * The right thing to do for callables and classes manually type-checked with
      the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.
    * The wrong thing to do for callables and classes automatically type-checked
      by import hooks installed by public functions exported by the
      :mod:`beartype.claw` subpackage. Why? Because doing so would render those
      import hooks fragile to the point of being practically useless on
      real-world packages and codebases by unexpectedly failing on the first
      callable or class defined *anywhere* under a package that is not
      type-checkable by :func:`beartype.beartype` (whether through our fault or
      that package's). Instead, the right thing to do is to:

      * Emit a warning for each callable or class that :func:`beartype.beartype`
        fails to generate a type-checking wrapper for.
      * Proceed to the next callable or class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : BeartypeableT
        **Beartypeable** (i.e., pure-Python callable or class) to be decorated.
    conf : BeartypeConf, optional
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all flags, options, settings, and other metadata configuring the
        current decoration of the decorated callable or class).
    warning_category : TypeWarning
        Category of the non-fatal warning to emit if :func:`beartype.beartype`
        fails to generate a type-checking wrapper for this callable or class.

    Returns
    ----------
    BeartypeableT
        Either:

        * If the passed object is a class, this existing class embellished with
          dynamically generated type-checking.
        * If the passed object is a callable, a new callable wrapping that
          callable with dynamically generated type-checking.

    Warns
    ----------
    warning_category
        If :func:`beartype.beartype` fails to generate a type-checking wrapper
        for this callable or class by raising a fatal exception, this function
        coerces that exception into a non-fatal warning describing that error.
