#FIXME: For efficiency, register tuples under their numeric hashes rather than
#strings embedding numeric hashes formatted as "+{numeric_hash}". Thus:
#* Tuples would be registered instead with numeric hashes.
#* Types would continue to be registered with fully-qualified classnames.
#
#Note that there's guaranteed to be *NO* key collisions between the two, as
#the first characters of Python identifiers and thus classnames are prohibited
#from being digits. Conversely, all characters (and thus the first characters)
#of numeric hashes are guaranteed to be digits. Ergo, no collisions.

    '''
    Register the passed tuple of one or more **PEP-noncompliant types** (i.e.,
    classes neither defined by the :mod:`typing` module *nor* subclassing such
    classes) with the beartypistry singleton *and* return a Python
    expression evaluating to this tuple when accessed via the private
    ``__beartypistry`` parameter implicitly passed to all wrapper functions
    generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

    This function is memoized for both efficiency *and* safety, preventing
    accidental reregistration.

    Design
    ----------
    Unlike types, tuples are commonly dynamically constructed on-the-fly by
    various tuple factories (e.g., :attr:`beartype.cave.NoneTypeOr`,
    :attr:`typing.Optional`) and hence have no reliable fully-qualified names.
    Instead, this function synthesizes the string uniquely identifying this
    tuple as the concatenation of:

    * The magic substring :data:`_TYPISTRY_HINT_NAME_TUPLE_PREFIX`. Since
      fully-qualified classnames uniquely identifying types as beartypistry
      keys are guaranteed to *never* contain this substring, this substring
      prevents collisions between tuple and type names.
    * This tuple's hash. Note that this tuple's object ID is intentionally
      *not* embedded in this string. Two tuples with the same items are
      typically different objects and thus have different object IDs, despite
      producing identical hashes: e.g.,

          >>> ('Das', 'Kapitel',) is ('Das', 'Kapitel',)
          False
          >>> id(('Das', 'Kapitel',)) == id(('Das', 'Kapitel',))
          False
          >>> hash(('Das', 'Kapitel',)) == hash(('Das', 'Kapitel',))
          True

      The exception is the empty tuple, which is a singleton and thus *always*
      has the same object ID and hash: e.g.,

          >>> () is ()
          True
          >>> id(()) == id(())
          True
          >>> hash(()) == hash(())
          True

    Identifying tuples by their hashes enables the beartypistry singleton to
    transparently cache duplicate tuple unions having distinct object IDs as
    the same underlying object, reducing space consumption. While hashing
    tuples *does* impact time performance, the tangible gains are considered
    worth the cost.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : tuple
        Tuple of all PEP-noncompliant types to be registered.
    is_types_unique : bool
        ``True`` only if the caller guarantees this tuple to contain *no*
        duplicates. If ``False``, this function assumes this tuple to contain
        duplicates by internally:

        #. Coercing this tuple into a set, thus implicitly ignoring both
           duplicates and ordering of types in this tuple.
        #. Coercing that set back into another tuple.
        #. If these two tuples differ, the passed tuple contains one or more
           duplicates; in this case, the duplicate-free tuple is registered.
        #. Else, the passed tuple contains no duplicates; in this case, the
           passed tuple is registered.

        Ergo, this boolean does *not* simply enable an edge-case optimization
        (though it certainly does do that). This boolean enables callers to
        guarantee that this function registers the passed tuple rather than a
        new tuple internally created by this function.

    Returns
    ----------
    str
        Python expression evaluating to this tuple when accessed via the
        private ``__beartypistry`` parameter implicitly passed to all wrapper
        functions generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

    Raises
    ----------
    _BeartypeDecorBeartypistryException
        If this tuple is either:

        * *Not* a tuple.
        * Is a tuple containing one or more items that are either:

          * *Not* types.
          * **PEP-compliant types** (i.e., either classes defined by the
            :mod:`typing` module *or* subclasses of such classes and thus

        Dunder method explicitly called by the superclass
        :meth:`dict.__getitem__` method implicitly called on caller attempts to
        access the passed missing key with ``[``- and ``]``-delimited syntax.

        This method treats this attempt to get this missing key as the
        intentional resolution of a forward reference whose fully-qualified
        classname is this key.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hint_classname : str
            **Name** (i.e., fully-qualified name of the user-defined class) of
            this hint to be resolved as a forward reference.

        Returns
        ----------
        type
            User-defined class whose fully-qualified name is this missing key.

        Raises
        ----------
        BeartypeCallHintForwardRefException
            If either:

            * This name is *not* a syntactically valid fully-qualified
              classname.

            * An importable module prefixed by this name exists *but* this
              module declares no attribute by this name.
            * The module attribute to which this name refers is *not* a class.
