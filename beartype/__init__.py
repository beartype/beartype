constants published by the :mod:`beartype.meta` submodule. These metadata
constants are commonly inspected (and thus expected) by external automation.

Human-readable package version as a ``.``-delimited string.

For :pep:`8` compliance, this specifier has the canonical name ``__version__``
rather than that of a typical global (e.g., ``VERSION_STR``).

Note that this is the canonical version specifier for this package. Indeed, the
top-level ``pyproject.toml`` file dynamically derives its own ``version`` string
from this string global.

pyproject.toml
   The Hatch-specific ``[tool.hatch.version]`` subsection of the top-level
   ``pyproject.toml`` file, which parses its version from this string global.

'''
Special list global of the unqualified names of all public package attributes
explicitly exported by and thus safely importable from this package.

Caveats
-------
**This global is defined only for conformance with static type checkers,** a
necessary prerequisite for :pep:`561`-compliance. This global is *not* intended
to enable star imports of the form ``from beartype import *`` (now largely
considered a harmful anti-pattern by the Python community), although it
technically does the latter as well.

This global would ideally instead reference *only* a single package attribute
guaranteed *not* to exist (e.g., ``'STAR_IMPORTS_CONSIDERED_HARMFUL'``),
effectively disabling star imports. Since doing so induces spurious static
type-checking failures, we reluctantly embrace the standard approach. For
example, :mod:`mypy` emits an error resembling:

    error: Module 'beartype' does not explicitly export attribute 'beartype';
    implicit reexport disabled.

def __getattr__(attr_name: str) -> object:
    '''
    Dynamically retrieve a deprecated attribute with the passed unqualified name
    from this submodule and emit a non-fatal deprecation warning on each such
    retrieval if this submodule defines this attribute *or* raise an exception
    otherwise.

    The Python interpreter implicitly calls this :pep:`562`-compliant module
    dunder function under Python >= 3.7 *after* failing to directly retrieve an
    explicit attribute with this name from this submodule. Since this dunder
    function is only called in the event of an error, neither space nor time
    efficiency are a concern here.

    Parameters
    ----------
    attr_name : str
        Unqualified name of the deprecated attribute to be retrieved.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        Value of this deprecated attribute.

    Warns
    -----
    DeprecationWarning
        If this attribute is deprecated.

    Raises
    ------
    AttributeError
        If this attribute is unrecognized and thus erroneous.
