**Beartype slow cave** (i.e., private subset of the public :mod:`beartype.cave`
subpackage profiled to *not* be efficiently importable at :mod:`beartype`
startup and thus *not* safely importable throughout the internal
:mod:`beartype` codebase).

This submodule currently imports from expensive third-party packages on
importation (e.g., :mod:`numpy`) despite :mod:`beartype` itself *never*
requiring those imports. Until resolved, that subpackage is considered tainted.

_VersionComparableTypes: Tuple[type, ...] = (tuple,)

Tuple of all **comparable version types** (i.e., types suitable for use both as
parameters to callables accepting arbitrary version specifiers *and* as
operands to numeric operators comparing such specifiers) if
:mod:`pkg_resources` is importable *or* ``(tuple,)`` otherwise.

This is the proper subset of types listed by the :data:`_VersionTypes` tuple
that are directly comparable, thus excluding the :class:`str` type.
``.``-delimited version specifier strings are only indirectly comparable after
conversion to a comparable version type.

Caveats
----------
Note that all types listed by this tuple are *only* safely comparable with
versions of the same type. In particular, the types listed by the
:class:`_SetuptoolsVersionTypes` tuple do *not* necessarily support direct
comparison with either the :class:`tuple` *or* `class:`str` version types;
ironically, those types supported both under older but *not* newer versions of
:mod:`setuptools`. This is why we can't have good things.

Tuple of all **mutable** and **immutable sequence types** (i.e., both concrete
