    **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating all
    flags, options, settings, and other metadata configuring each type-checking
    operation performed by :mod:`beartype` -- including each decoration of a
    callable or class by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).

    Attributes
    ----------
    _claw_decoration_position_funcs : BeartypeDecorationPosition
        **Import hook callable decorator position** (i.e., location to which the
        :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator will be implicitly injected into
        existing chains of one or more decorators decorating functions and
        methods defined by modules imported under :mod:`beartype.claw` import
        hooks).
    _claw_decoration_position_types : BeartypeDecorationPosition
        **Import hook class decorator position** (i.e., location to which the
        :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator will be implicitly injected into
        existing chains of one or more decorators decorating classes defined by
        modules imported under :mod:`beartype.claw` import hooks).
    _claw_is_pep526 : bool
        :data:`True` only if type-checking **annotated variable assignments**
        (i.e., :pep:`526`-compliant assignments to local, global, class, and
        instance variables annotated by type hints) when importing modules
        under import hooks published by the :mod:`beartype.claw` subpackage. See
        also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _conf_args : tuple
        Tuple of the values of *all* possible keyword parameters (in arbitrary
        order) configuring this configuration.
    _conf_kwargs : Dict[str, object]
        Dictionary mapping from the names to values of *all* possible keyword
        parameters configuring this configuration.
    _hash : int
        Precomputed configuration hash returned by the :meth:`__hash__` dunder
        method for efficiency.
    _hint_overrides : Dict
        **Type hint overrides** (i.e., frozen dictionary mapping from arbitrary
        source to target type hints), enabling callers to lie to both their
        users and all other packages other than :mod:`beartype`. This dictionary
        enables callers to externally present a public API annotated by
        simplified type hints while internally instructing :mod:`beartype` to
        privately type-check that API under a completely different set of
        (typically more complicated) type hints.
    _is_color : Optional[bool]
        Tri-state boolean governing how and whether beartype colours
        **type-checking violations** (i.e.,
        :class:`beartype.roar.BeartypeCallHintViolation` exceptions) with
        POSIX-compliant ANSI escape sequences for readability. Specifically, if
        this boolean is:

        * :data:`False`, beartype *never* colours type-checking violations
          raised by callables configured with this configuration.
        * :data:`True`, beartype *always* colours type-checking violations
          raised by callables configured with this configuration.
        * :data:`None`, beartype conditionally colours type-checking violations
          raised by callables configured with this configuration only when
          standard output is attached to an interactive terminal.
    _is_debug : bool
        :data:`True` only if debugging :mod:`beartype`. See also the
        :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _is_pep484_tower : bool
        :data:`True` only if enabling support for the :pep:`484`-compliant
        implicit numeric tower. See also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _is_violation_door_warn : bool
        :data:`True` only if :attr:`violation_door_type` is a warning subclass.
        Note that this is stored only as a negligible optimization to avoid
        needless recomputation of this boolean during code generation.
    _is_violation_param_warn : bool
        :data:`True` only if :attr:`violation_param_type` is a warning subclass.
        Note that this is stored only as a negligible optimization to avoid
        needless recomputation of this boolean during code generation.
    _is_violation_return_warn : bool
        :data:`True` only if :attr:`violation_return_type` is a warning
        subclass. Note that this is stored only as a negligible optimization to
        avoid needless recomputation of this boolean during code generation.
    _is_warning_cls_on_decorator_exception_set : bool
        :data:`True` only if the caller explicitly passed the
        :attr:`_warning_cls_on_decorator_exception` parameter. See
        also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _repr : Optional[str]
        Either:

        * If the :func:`repr` builtin has yet to call the :meth:`__repr__`
          dunder method, :data:`None`.
        * Else, the machine-readable representation of this configuration,
    _strategy : BeartypeStrategy
        **Type-checking strategy** (i.e., :class:`BeartypeStrategy` enumeration
        member) with which to implement all type-checks in the wrapper function
        dynamically generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator for
        the decorated callable.
    _violation_door_type : TypeException
        **DOOR violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by the
        :func:`beartype.door.die_if_unbearable` type-checker when the object
        passed to that type-checker violates the type hint passed to that
        type-checker). See also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _violation_param_type : TypeException
        **Parameter violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by
        callables generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when
        those callables receive parameters violating the type hints annotating
        those parameters). See also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _violation_return_type : TypeException
        **Return violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by callables
        generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when those
        callables return values violating the type hints annotating those
        returns). See also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _violation_type : Optional[TypeException]
        **Default violation type** (i.e., type of exception to default whichever
        of the ``violation_door_type``, ``violation_param_type``, and
        ``violation_return_type`` exception types are unpassed and thus
        :data:`None`). See also the :meth:`__new__` method docstring.
    _violation_verbosity : BeartypeViolationVerbosity
        **Violation verbosity** (i.e., positive integer in the inclusive range
        ``[1, 5]`` governing the verbosity of exception messages raised by
        type-checking wrappers generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype`
        decorator when either receiving parameters *or* returning values
        violating their annotated type hints). See also the :meth:`__new__`
        method docstring.
    _warning_cls_on_decorator_exception : Optional[TypeWarning]
        Configuration parameter governing whether the :func:`beartype.beartype`
        decorator reduces otherwise fatal exceptions raised at decoration time
        to equivalent non-fatal warnings of this warning category. See also the
        :meth:`__new__` method docstring.

        Instantiate this configuration if needed (i.e., if *no* prior
        configuration with these same parameters was previously instantiated)
        *or* reuse that previously instantiated configuration otherwise.

        This dunder methods guarantees beartype configurations to be memoized:

        .. code-block:: python

           >>> from beartype import BeartypeConf
           >>> BeartypeConf() is BeartypeConf()
           True

        This memoization is *not* merely an optimization. The
        :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator internally memoizes the private
        closure it creates and returns on the basis of this configuration,
        which *must* thus also be memoized.

        Parameters
        ----------
        check_time_max_multiplier : Union[int, None] = 1000
            **Deadline multiplier** (i.e., positive integer instructing
            :mod:`beartype` to prematurely halt the current type-check when the
            total running time of the active Python interpreter exceeds this
            integer multiplied by the running time consumed by both the current
            type-check and all prior type-checks *and* the caller also passed a
            non-default ``strategy``) *or* :data:`None` if :mod:`beartype`
            should never prematurely halt runtime type-checks.

            Increasing this integer increases the number of container items that
            :mod:`beartype` type-checks at a cost of decreasing application
            responsiveness. Likewise, decreasing this integer increases
            application responsiveness at a cost of decreasing the number of
            container items that :mod:`beartype` type-checks.

            Ignored when ``strategy`` is :attr:`BeartypeStrategy.O1`, as that
            strategy is already effectively instantaneous; imposing deadlines
            and thus bureaucratic bookkeeping on that strategy would only
            reduce its efficiency for no good reason, which is a bad reason.

            Defaults to 1000, in which case a maximum of 0.10% of the total
            runtime of the active Python process will be devoted to performing
            non-constant :mod:`beartype` type-checks over container items. This
            default has been carefully tuned to strike a reasonable balance
            between runtime type-check coverage and application responsiveness,
            typically enabling smaller containers to be fully type-checked
            without noticeably impacting codebase performance.

            **Theory time.** Let:

            * :math:`T` be the total time this interpreter has been running.
            * :math:``b` be the total time :mod:`beartype` has spent
              type-checking in this interpreter.

            Clearly, :math:`b <= T`. Generally, :math:`b <<<<<<< T` (i.e.,
            type-checks consume much less time than the total time consumed by
            the process). However, it's all too easy to exhibit worst-case
            behaviour of :math:`b ~= T` (i.e., type-checks consume most of the
            total time). How? By passing the :func:`beartype.door.is_bearable`
            tester an absurdly large nested container subject to the non-default
            ``strategy`` of :attr:`BeartypeStrategy.On`.

            This deadline multiplier mitigates that worst-case behaviour.
            Specifically, :mod:`beartype` will prematurely halt any iterative
            type-check across a container when this constraint is triggered:

            .. code-block:: python

               b * check_time_max_multiplier >= T
        claw_decoration_position_funcs : BeartypeDecorationPosition, optional
            **Import hook callable decorator position** (i.e., location to which
            the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator will be implicitly injected
            into existing chains of one or more decorators decorating functions

            global, class, or instance variables annotated by type hints) when
            importing modules under :mod:`beartype.claw` import hooks by
            injecting calls to the :func:`beartype.door.die_if_unbearable`
            function immediately *after* those assignments in those modules.
            Enabling this boolean:

            * Effectively augments :mod:`beartype` into a full-blown **hybrid
              runtime-static type-checker** (i.e., performing both standard
              runtime type-checking *and* non-standard static type-checking at
              runtime).
            * Adds mostly negligible runtime overhead to all annotated variable
              assignments in all modules imported under those import hooks.
              Although the *individual* cost of this overhead for any given
              assignment is negligible, the *aggregate* cost across all such
              assignments could be non-negligible in worst-case use cases.

            Ideally, this boolean should only be disabled for a small subset of
            performance-sensitive modules *after* profiling those modules to
            suffer performance regressions under :mod:`beartype.claw` import
            hooks. Defaults to :data:`True`.
        hint_overrides : BeartypeHintOverrides
            **Type hint overrides** (i.e., frozen dictionary mapping from
            arbitrary source to target type hints), enabling callers to lie to
            both their users and all other packages other than :mod:`beartype`.
            This dictionary enables callers to externally present a public API
            annotated by simplified type hints while internally instructing
            :mod:`beartype` to privately type-check that API under a completely
            different set of (typically more complicated) type hints. Doing so
            preserves a facade of simplicity for downstream consumers like end
            users, static type-checkers, and document generators. Defaults to
            the empty dictionary.

            Specifically, for each source type hint annotating each callable,
            class, or variable assignment observed by :mod:`beartype`, if that
            source type hint is a key of this dictionary, :mod:`beartype` maps
            that source type hint to the corresponding target type hint in this
            dictionary. That target type hint then globally "overrides" (i.e.,
            replaces, substitutes for) that source type hint. :mod:`beartype`
            then uses that target type hint in place of that source type hint.

            For example, consider this Abomination Unto the Eyes of Guido:

            .. code-block:: python

               from beartype, BeartypeConf, BeartypeHintOverrides

               # @beartype decorator configured to expand all "float" type hints
               # to "int | float" type hints.
               lyingbeartype = beartype(conf=BeartypeConf(
                   hint_overrides=BeartypeHintOverrides({float: int | float})))

               # The @lyingbeartype decorator now expands this signature...
               @lyingbeartype
               def lies(all_lies: list[int]) -> int:
                   return all_lies[0]

               # ...as if it had been annotated like this instead.
               @beartype
               def lies(all_lies: list[int | float]) -> int | float:
                   return all_lies[0]
        is_color : BoolTristateUnpassable
            Tri-state boolean governing how and whether beartype colours
            **type-checking violations** (i.e.,
            :class:`beartype.roar.BeartypeCallHintViolation` exceptions) with
            POSIX-compliant ANSI escape sequences for readability. Specifically,
            if this boolean is:

            * :data:`False`, beartype *never* colours type-checking violations
              raised by callables configured with this configuration.
            * :data:`True`, beartype *always* colours type-checking violations
              raised by callables configured with this configuration.
            * :data:`None`, beartype conditionally colours type-checking
              violations raised by callables configured with this configuration
              only when standard output is attached to an interactive terminal.

            The ``${BEARTYPE_IS_COLOR}`` environment variable globally overrides
            *all* attempts by *all* callers to explicitly pass this parameter,
            enabling end users to enforce a global colour policy across their
            full app stack. If ``${BEARTYPE_IS_COLOR}`` is set to a different
            value than that of this parameter, this constructor emits a
            non-fatal :class:`beartype.roar.BeartypeConfShellVarWarning` warning
            informing the caller of this configuration conflict. To avoid this
            conflict, open-source libraries are recommended to *not* pass this
            parameter; ideally, *only* end user apps should pass this parameter.

            Effectively defaults to :data:`None`. Technically, this parameter
            defaults to a private magic constant *not* intended to be passed by
            callers, enabling :mod:`beartype` to reliably detect whether the
            caller has explicitly passed this parameter or not.
        is_debug : bool, optional
            :data:`True` only if debugging :mod:`beartype`. Enabling this
            boolean:

            * Prints the definition (including both the signature and body) of
              each type-checking wrapper function dynamically generated by
              :mod:`beartype` to standard output.
            * Caches the body of each type-checking wrapper function dynamically
              generated by :mod:`beartype` with the standard :mod:`linecache`
              module, enabling these function bodies to be introspected at
              runtime *and* improving the readability of tracebacks whose call
              stacks contain one or more calls to these
              :func:`beartype.beartype`-decorated functions.
            * Appends to the declaration of each **hidden parameter** (i.e.,
              whose name is prefixed by ``"__beartype_"`` and whose value is
              that of an external attribute internally referenced in the body of
              that function) the machine-readable representation of the initial
              value of that parameter, stripped of newlines and truncated to a
              hopefully sensible length. Since the
              :func:`beartype._util.text.utiltextrepr.represent_object` function
              called to do so is shockingly slow, these substrings are
              conditionally embedded in the returned signature *only* when
              enabling this boolean.

            Defaults to :data:`False`.
        is_pep484_tower : bool, optional
            :data:`True` only if enabling support for the :pep:`484`-compliant
            **implicit numeric tower** (i.e., lossy conversion of integers to
            floating-point numbers *and* both integers and floating-point
            numbers to complex numbers). Specifically, enabling this instructs
            :mod:`beartype` to automatically expand:

            * All :class:`float` type hints to ``float | int``, thus implicitly
              accepting both integers and floating-point numbers for objects
              annotated as only accepting floating-point numbers.
            * All :class:`complex` type hints to ``complex | float | int``, thus
              implicitly accepting integers, floating-point, and complex numbers
              for objects annotated as only accepting complex numbers.

            Defaults to :data:`False` to minimize precision error introduced by
            lossy conversions from integers to floating-point numbers to complex
            numbers. Since most integers do *not* have exact representations
            as floating-point numbers, each conversion of an integer into a
            floating-point number typically introduces a small precision error
            that accumulates over multiple conversions and operations into a
            larger precision error. Enabling this improves the usability of
            public APIs at a cost of introducing precision errors.
        strategy : BeartypeStrategy, optional
            **Type-checking strategy** (i.e., :class:`BeartypeStrategy`
            enumeration member) with which to implement all type-checks in the
            wrapper function dynamically generated by the
            :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator for the decorated callable.
            Defaults to :attr: `BeartypeStrategy.O1`, the ``O(1)`` constant-time
            strategy.
        violation_door_type : Optional[TypeException]
            **DOOR violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by the
            :func:`beartype.door.die_if_unbearable` type-checker when the object
            passed to that type-checker violates the type hint passed to that
            type-checker). Defaults to :data:`None`, in which case this type
            defaults to either:

            * If ``violation_type`` is passed and *not* :data:`None`, that type.
            * Else, :exc:`.BeartypeDoorHintViolation`.
        violation_param_type : Optional[TypeException]
            **Parameter violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by
            callables generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when
            those callables receive parameters violating the type hints
            annotating those parameters). Defaults to :data:`None`, in which
            case this type defaults to either:

            * If ``violation_type`` is passed and *not* :data:`None`, that type.
            * Else, :exc:`.BeartypeCallHintParamViolation`.
        violation_return_type : Optional[TypeException]
            **Return violation type** (i.e., type of exception raised by
            callables generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when
            those callables return values violating the type hints annotating
            those returns). Defaults to :data:`None`, in which case this type
            defaults to either:

            * If ``violation_type`` is passed and *not* :data:`None`, that type.
            * Else, :exc:`.BeartypeCallHintReturnViolation`.
        violation_type : Optional[TypeException]
            **Default violation type** (i.e., type of exception to default
            whichever of the ``violation_door_type``, ``violation_param_type``,
            and ``violation_return_type`` exception types are unpassed and thus
            :data:`None`).  This parameter is merely a convenience enabling
            callers to trivially control the ``violation_door_type``,
            ``violation_param_type``, and ``violation_return_type`` parameters
            *without* having to explicitly pass all three of those parameters.
            Specifically, if this parameter is:

            * *Not* :data:`None`, then the ``violation_door_type``,
              ``violation_param_type``, and ``violation_return_type`` parameters
              all default to the value of this parameter.
            * :data:`None`, then:

              * ``violation_door_type`` defaults to
                :exc:`.BeartypeDoorHintViolation`.
              * ``violation_param_type`` defaults to
                :exc:`.BeartypeCallHintParamViolation`.
              * ``violation_return_type`` defaults to
                :exc:`.BeartypeCallHintReturnViolation`.

            Defaults to :data:`None`.
        violation_verbosity : BeartypeViolationVerbosity, optional
            **Violation verbosity** (i.e., positive integer in the inclusive
            range ``[1, 5]`` governing the verbosity of exception messages
            raised by type-checking wrappers generated by the
            :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator when either receiving parameters
            *or* returning values violating their annotated type hints).
            Defaults to :attr:`.BeartypeViolationVerbosity.DEFAULT`.
        warning_cls_on_decorator_exception : Optional[TypeWarning]
            Configuration parameter governing whether the
            :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator reduces what would otherwise be
            fatal exceptions raised at decoration time to equivalent non-fatal
            warnings of the passed **warning category** (i.e., subclass of the
            standard :class:`Warning` class). Specifically, this parameter may
            be either:

            * :data:`None`, in which case the :func:`beartype.beartype`
              decorator raises fatal exceptions at decoration time.
            * A warning category, in which case the :func:`beartype.beartype`
              decorator reduces fatal exceptions to non-fatal warnings of this
              category at decoration time.

            Defaults to a private warning type *not* intended to be passed by
            callers, enabling :mod:`beartype` to reliably detect when the caller
            has *not* explicitly passed this parameter and respond accordingly
            by defaulting this parameter to a context-dependent value. Notably,
            if this parameter is *not* explicitly passed:

            * The :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator defaults this parameter to
              :data:`None`, thus raising decoration-time exceptions.
            * The :mod:`beartype.claw` API defaults this parameter to the public
              :class:`beartype.roar.BeartypeClawDecorWarning` warning category,
              thus reducing decoration-time exceptions to warnings of that
              category when performing import hooks. This default behaviour
              significantly increases the likelihood that import hooks installed
              by :mod:`beartype.claw` will successfully decorate the entirety of
              their target packages rather than prematurely halt with a single
              fatal exception at the first decoration issue.

instantiated with *no* parameters and thus default parameters), globalized to
trivially optimize external access to this configuration throughout this
codebase.

Note that this global is *not* publicized to end users, who can simply
instantiate ``BeartypeConf()`` to obtain the same singleton.
