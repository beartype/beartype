    * All :class:`float` type hints to ``float | int``, thus implicitly
      accepting both integers and floating-point numbers for objects annotated

      implicitly accepting integers, floating-point, and complex numbers for

    intentionally defined as a memoized function rather than a global variable
    of this submodule. Why? Because the latter approach induces a circular
