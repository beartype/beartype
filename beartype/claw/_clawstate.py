    Attributes
    ----------
    beartype_pathhook : Optional[ImportPathHook]
        Either:

        * If the
          :func:`beartype.claw._importlib.clawimppath.add_beartype_pathhook`
          function has been previously called at least once under the active
          Python interpreter and the
          :func:`beartype.claw._importlib.clawimppath.remove_beartype_pathhook`
          function has not been called more recently, the **beartype import path
          hook singleton** (i.e., factory closure creating and returning a new
          :class:`importlib.machinery.FileFinder` instance itself creating and
          leveraging a new :class:`.BeartypeSourceFileLoader` instance).
        * Else, :data:`None`.

        Initialized to :data:`None`.
    module_name_to_beartype_conf : ModuleNameToBeartypeConf
        **Hooked module beartype configuration cache** (i.e., non-thread-safe
        dictionary mapping from the fully-qualified name of each previously
        imported submodule of each package previously registered in our global
        package trie to the beartype configuration configuring type-checking by
        the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator of that submodule).
    node_scope_beforelist_global : BeartypeNodeScopeBeforelist
        **Abstract syntax tree (AST) global scope beforelist** (i.e., low-level
        dataclass aggregating all metadata required to manage the beforelist
        automating decorator positioning across all global scopes of all modules
        recursively visited by :mod:`beartype.claw` AST transformers).
    packages_trie_blacklist : PackagesTrieWhitelist
        **Package trie blacklist** (i.e., non-thread-safe recursively nested
        dictionary implementing a prefix tree such that each key-value pair maps
        from the unqualified basename of each subpackage to *not* be implicitly
        type-checked on the first importation of that subpackage to another
        instance of the :class:`.PackagesTrieWhitelist` class similarly
        describing the sub-subpackages of that subpackage).
    packages_trie_whitelist : PackagesTrieWhitelist
        **Package trie whitelist** (i.e., non-thread-safe recursively nested
        dictionary implementing a prefix tree such that each key-value pair maps
        from the unqualified basename of each subpackage to be implicitly
        type-checked on the first importation of that subpackage to another
