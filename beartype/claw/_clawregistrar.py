**Beartype all-at-once low-level package name cache.**

This private submodule caches package names on behalf of the higher-level
:func:`beartype.claw.beartype_submodules_on_import` function. Beartype import
path hooks internally created by that function subsequently lookup these package
names from this cache when deciding whether or not (and how) to decorate a
submodule being imported with :func:`beartype.beartype`.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

    #   reduces the runtime efficiency of the "beartype" package.
    # * Fundamentally dangerous, which is the greater concern. For example:
    #   The beartype.claw._clawast.BeartypeNodeTransformer.visit_Module()
    #   dynamically inserts a module-scoped import of the
    #   @beartype._decor.decorcore.beartype_object_safe decorator at the head of

    #   force reimportation of all modules by emptying the "sys.modules" cache.

**Package name cache** (i.e., non-thread-safe dictionary mapping in a
recursively nested manner from the unqualified basename of each subpackage to be
possibly type-checked on first importation by the :func:`beartype.beartype`
decorator to either the ``None`` singleton if that subpackage is to be
type-checked *or* a nested dictionary satisfying the same structure otherwise
(i.e., if that subpackage is *not* to be type-checked)).

Motivation
----------
This dictionary is intentionally structured as a non-trivial nested data
structure rather than a trivial non-nested flat dictionary. Why? Efficiency.
Consider this flattened set of package names:

    .. code-block:: python

       _package_names = {'a.b', 'a.c', 'd'}

Deciding whether an arbitrary package name is in that set or not requires
worst-case ``O(n)`` iteration across the set of ``n`` package names.

Consider instead this nested dictionary whose keys are package names split on
``.`` delimiters and whose values are either recursively nested dictionaries of
the same format *or* the ``None`` singleton (terminating the current package
name):

    .. code-block:: python

       _package_basename_to_subpackages = {
           'a': {'b': None, 'c': None}, 'd': None}

Deciding whether an arbitrary package name is in this dictionary or not requires
worst-case ``O(h)`` iteration across the height ``h`` of this dictionary
(equivalent to the largest number of ``.`` delimiters for any fully-qualified
package name encapsulated by this dictionary). Since ``h <<<<<<<<<< n``, this
dictionary provides substantially faster worst-case lookup than that set.

Moreover, in the worst case:

* That set requires one inefficient string prefix test for each item.
* This dictionary requires *only* one efficient string equality test for each
  nested key-value pair while descending towards the target package name.

Let's do this, fam.

Caveats
----------
**This global is only safely accessible in a thread-safe manner from within a**
``with _claw_lock:`` **context manager.** Equivalently, this global is *not*
safely accessible outside that manager.

Examples
----------
Instance of this data structure type-checking on import submodules of the root
``package_z`` package, the child ``package_a.subpackage_k`` submodule, and the
``package_a.subpackage_b.subpackage_c`` and
``package_a.subpackage_b.subpackage_d`` submodules:

    >>> _package_basename_to_subpackages = {
    ...     'package_a': {
    ...         'subpackage_b': {
    ...             'subpackage_c': None,
    ...             'subpackage_d': None,
    ...         },
    ...         'subpackage_k': None,
    ...     },
    ...     'package_z': None,
    ... }
