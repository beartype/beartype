    This (sub)cache is suitable for caching as the values of:

    * The :data:`.packages_trie_whitelist` global dictionary.
    * Each (sub)value mapped to by that global dictionary.

    Motivation
    ----------
    This dictionary is intentionally implemented as a nested trie data structure
    rather than a trivial non-nested flat dictionary. Why? Efficiency. Consider
    this flattened set of package names:

    .. code-block:: python

       package_names = {'a.b', 'a.c', 'd'}

    Deciding whether an arbitrary package name is in this set requires
    worst-case :math:`O(n)` iteration across the set of :math:`n` package names.

    Consider instead this nested trie whose keys are package names split on
    ``"."`` delimiters and whose values are either recursively nested
    dictionaries of the same format *or* the :data:`None` singleton (terminating
    the current package name):

    .. code-block:: python

       package_names_trie = {'a': {'b': None, 'c': None}, 'd': None}

    Deciding whether an arbitrary package name is in this trie only requires
    worst-case :math:`O(h)` iteration across the height :math:`h` of this
    dictionary (equivalent to the largest number of ``"."`` delimiters for any
    fully-qualified package name encapsulated by this trie). ``h <<<< n``, so
    this trie offers *much* faster worst-case lookup than that set.

    Moreover, in the worst case:

    * That set requires one inefficient string prefix test for each item.
    * This trie requires *only* one efficient string equality test for each
      nested key-value pair while descending towards the target package name.

    Let's do this, fam.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This dictionary is only safely accessible in a thread-safe manner from

def iter_packages_trie(

    '''
    Thread-safe generator iteratively yielding one **(sub)package (sub)trie
    whitelist** (i.e., :class:`PackagesTrieWhitelist` instance) describing each
    transitive parent package of the package with the passed name if this
    package or a parent package of this package was hooked by a prior call to
    the :func:`beartype.claw._package.clawpkghook.hook_packages` function *or*
    the empty iterable otherwise otherwise (i.e., if neither this package nor a
    parent package of this package was hooked by such a call).

    Specifically, this generator yields (in order):

    #. The subtrie of this trie configuring the root package of the passed
       (sub)package.
    #. And so on, until eventually yielding...
    #. The subsubtrie of this subtrie configuring the passed (sub)package
       itself.

    This generator intentionally avoids yielding the global trie
    :data:`beartype.claw._clawstate.packages_trie_whitelist`, which is already
    accessible via that global.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This function is only safely callable in a thread-safe manner from within
    a** ``with claw_lock:`` **context manager.** Equivalently, this function is
    *not* safely callable outside that manager.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Collection of each unqualified basename comprising the fully-qualified
        name of the package to be inspected, split by the caller from this
        name on ``"."`` delimiters.

    Yields
    ------

        (Sub)package configuration (sub)trie describing the currently iterated
        transitive parent package of the package with this name.
