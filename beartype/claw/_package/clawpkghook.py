    Register a new **beartype package import path hook** (i.e., callable
    inserted to the front of the standard :mod:`sys.path_hooks` list recursively
    applying the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator to all typed callables and
    classes of all submodules of all packages with the passed names on the first
    importation of those submodules).

    Parameters
    ----------
    claw_coverage : BeartypeClawCoverage
        **Import hook coverage** (i.e., competing package scope over which to
        apply the path hook added by this function, each with concomitant
        tradeoffs with respect to runtime complexity and quality assurance).
    conf : BeartypeConf
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., dataclass configuring the
        :mod:`beartype.beartype` decorator for *all* decoratable objects
        recursively decorated by the path hook added by this function).
    package_name : Optional[str]
        Either:

        * If ``coverage`` is :attr:`.BeartypeClawCoverage.PACKAGES_ONE`, the
          fully-qualified name of the package to be type-checked.
        * Else, ignored.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.
    package_names : Optional[Iterable[str]]]
        Either:

        * If ``coverage`` is :attr:`.BeartypeClawCoverage.PACKAGES_MANY`, an
          iterable of the fully-qualified names of one or more packages to be
          type-checked.
        * Else, ignored.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeClawHookException
        If either:

        * The passed ``package_names`` parameter is either:

          * Neither a string nor an iterable (i.e., fails to satisfy the
            :class:`collections.abc.Iterable` protocol).
          * An empty string or iterable.
          * A non-empty string that is *not* a valid **package name** (i.e.,
            ``"."``-delimited concatenation of valid Python identifiers).
          * A non-empty iterable containing at least one item that is either:

            * *Not* a string.
            * The empty string.
            * A non-empty string that is *not* a valid **package name** (i.e.,
              ``"."``-delimited concatenation of valid Python identifiers).

        * The passed ``conf`` parameter is *not* a beartype configuration (i.e.,
          :class:`.BeartypeConf` instance).
