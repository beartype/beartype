    function (which raises human-readable exceptions from wrapper functions
    when either passed a parameter or returning a value, referred to as the

    type-check required by that hint) when this pith appears to satisfy this
    type-check, a runtime paradox implying either:

    * The parent wrapper function generated by the :mod:`beartype.beartype`
      decorator type-checking this pith triggered a false negative by
      erroneously misdetecting this pith as failing this type check.
    * The
        :func:`beartype._decor._error.errormain.raise_pep_call_exception`
      function re-type-checking this pith triggered a false positive by
