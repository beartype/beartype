        Initialize this exception.

        This constructor (in order):

        #. Passes all passed arguments as is to the superclass constructor.

           exception from the private ``"beartype.roar._roarexc"`` submodule to
           the public ``"beartype.roar"`` subpackage to both improve the
           readability of exception messages and discourage end users from
           accessing this private submodule. By default, Python emits less

        Human-readable message describing this exception.

        Note that this dunder method *should* be redundant. Since the
        :meth:`__init__` method of this subclass explicitly passes this same
        exact message to the :meth:`__init__` method of the :exc:`Exception`
        superclass, there should be *no* need to expose this message yet again
        by defining this dunder method.

        Indeed, this dunder method *is* redundant for almost all edge cases --
        except one. For unknown reasons, the standard :mod:`multiprocessing`
        package renders a non-human-readable tuple rather than this
        human-readable message when a Python subprocess forked by a
        multiprocessing pool raises an instance of this exception resembling:

            beartype.roar.BeartypeDoorHintViolation: ('Die_if_unbearable() value
            \x1b[1m\x1b[31m42\x1b[0m violates type hint
            \x1b[1m\x1b[32mtyping.List[str]\x1b[0m, as \x1b[1m\x1b[33mint

        Clearly, this has something inexplicable to do with exception pickling
        internally performed by the :mod:`multiprocessing` package. Just as
        clearly, we have neither the inclination nor the patience to get to the
        bottom of this. Indeed, this implementation is inspired by the standard
        :exc:`subprocess.CalledProcessError` exception subclass -- which defines
        the ``__str__()`` dunder method in a similar manner and (presumably) for
        the exact same reasons. This is a mess that we want nothing to do with.

        Parameters
        ----------
        message : str
            Human-readable message describing this exception.
        culprits : Tuple[object, ...]
            Tuple of one or more **culprits** (i.e., user-defined objects
            directly responsible for this exception, typically due to violating

            If the culprits are either:

    @property
    def culprits(self) -> tuple:
        '''
        Tuple of one or more **culprits** (i.e., user-defined objects directly
        responsible for this exception, typically due to violating a type hint
        annotating a parameter passed to *or* object returned from the wrapper
        function generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator raising
        this exception).

        Specifically, this property returns either:

        * If a container (e.g., dictionary, list, set, tuple) is responsible for
          this exception, the 2-tuple ``(culprit_root, culprit_leaf)`` where:

          * ``culprit_root`` is the outermost such container. Typically, this is
            the passed parameter or returned value indirectly violating this
            hint.
          * ``culprit_leaf`` is the innermost item transitively contained in
            ``culprit_root`` directly violating this hint.

        * If a non-container (e.g., scalar, class instance) is responsible for
          this exception, the 1-tuple ``(culprit,)`` where ``culprit`` is that
          non-container.

        Caveats
        -------
        **This property is safely accessible from any context.** However, this
        property is most usefully accessed *only* from the ``except ...:`` block
        directly catching this exception. To avoid memory leaks, this property
        only weakly rather than strongly refers to these culprits and is thus
        best accessed only where these culprits are accessible. Notably, this
        property is guaranteed to refer to these culprits *only* for the
        duration of the ``except ...:`` block directly catching this exception.
        Since these culprits may be garbage-collected at any time thereafter,
        this property *cannot* be guaranteed to refer to these culprits outside
        that block. If this property is accessed from *any* other context and
        ore or more of these culprits have already been garbage-collected, the
        corresponding item(s) of this property are only the machine-readable
        representations of those culprits rather than those actual culprits.

        **This property returns the machine-readable representation of instances
        of builtin variable-sized C-based types** (e.g., :class:`dict`,
        :class:`int`, :class:`list`, :class:`tuple`) **rather than those
        instances themselves.** Why? Because CPython limitations prevent those
        instances from being weakly referred to. Blame Guido and the BDFL!
