# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Refactor this private submodule into a new public "beartype.caver"
#submodule, so-named as it enables users to externally create new ad-hoc
#protocols implementing structural subtyping resembling those predefined by
#"beartype.cave". To do so:
#
#* In the "beartype.caver" submodule:
#  * Define a new make_type_structural() function with signature resembling:
#    def make_type_structural(name: str, method_names: Iterable) -> type:
#  * Implement this function to dynamically create a new type with the passed
#    classname defining:
#    * Abstract methods with the passed method names.
#    * A __subclasshook__() dunder method checking the passed class for
#      concrete methods with these names.
#    To do so, note that abstract methods *CANNOT* be dynamically
#    monkey-patched in after class creation but *MUST* instead be statically
#    defined at class creation time (due to metaclass shenanigans).
#    Fortunately, doing so is trivial; simply use the three-argument form of
#    the type() constructor, as demonstrated by this StackOverflow answer:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/14219244/2809027
#  * *WAIT!* There's no need to call the type() constructor diroctly. Instead,
#    define a new make_type() function in this new submodule copied from the
#    betse.util.type.classes.define_class() function (but renamed, obviously).
#* Replace the current manual definition of "_BoolType" below with an in-place
#  call to that method from the "beartype.cave" submodule: e.g.,
#    BoolType = _make_type_structural(
#        name='BoolType', method_names=('__bool__',))
#
#Dis goin' be good.

def _check_methods(C: type, *methods: str) -> (bool, type(NotImplemented)):
    '''
    Private utility function called by abstract base classes (ABCs)
    implementing structural subtyping by detecting whether the passed class or
    some superclass of that class defines all of the methods with the passed
    method names.

    For safety, this function has been duplicated as is from its eponymous
    counterpart in the private stdlib :mod:`_colletions_abc` module.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : type
        Class to be validated as defining these methods.
    methods : Tuple[str]
        Tuple of the names of all methods to validate this class as defining.

    Returns
    ----------
    ``True``
        Only if this class defines all of these methods.
    ``NotImplemented``
        Only if this class fails to define one or more of these methods.

class _BoolType(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    '''
    Type of all **booleans** (i.e., objects defining the ``__bool__()`` dunder
    method; objects reducible in boolean contexts like ``if`` conditionals to
    either ``True`` or ``False``).

    This abstract base class (ABC) has been implemented ala standard container
    ABCs in the private stdlib :mod:`_collections_abc` module (e.g., the
    trivial :mod:`_collections_abc.Sized` type).
