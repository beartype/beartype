'''
Frozen set of the fully-qualified names of all **beartype-blacklisted
third-party modules** well-known to be hostile to runtime type-checking in
general and :mod:`beartype` specifically, usually due to employing one or more
of the following antipatterns:

* The **forward reference antipattern,** a `harmful design pattern officially
  promoted throughout "mypy" documentation <antipattern_>`__. This antipattern
  leverages both :pep:`563` *and* the :pep:`484`-compliant
  :obj:`typing.TYPE_CHECKING` global (both of which are well-known to be hostile
  to runtime type-checking) to conditionally define relative forward references
  visible *only* to pure static type-checkers like ``mypy`` and ``pyright``.
  These references are undefined at runtime and thus inaccessible to hybrid
  runtime-static type-checkers like :mod:`beartype` and :mod:`typeguard`.

  As an example, consider this hypothetical usage of the forward reference
  antipattern in a mock third-party package named ``"awful_package"``:

  .. code-block:: python

     from __future__ import annotations  # <-- pep 563
     from typing import TYPE_CHECKING    # <-- pep 484

     if TYPE_CHECKING:                         # <---- "False" at runtime
         from awful_package import AwfulClass  # <-- undefined at runtime

     # PEP 563 (i.e., "from __future__ import annotations") stringifies the
     # undefined "AwfulClass" class to the string "'AwfulClass'" at runtime.
     # Since the "AwfulClass" class is undefined, however, neither @beartype nor
     # any other runtime type-checker can resolve this relative forward
     # reference to the external "awful_package.AwfulClass" class it refers to.
     def awful_func(awful_arg: AwfulClass): ...
