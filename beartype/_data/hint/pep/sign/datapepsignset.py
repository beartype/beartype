defined as type hints that are acceptable when unsubscripted by child type hints
both:

* Technically, as formally standardized by one or more PEPs.
* Pragmatically, as effectively standardized by common usage throughout

This frozen set intentionally excludes:

* :pep:`484`-compliant **type hint factories** published by the standard
  :mod:`typing` module subsequently deprecated by :pep:`585` (e.g.,
  :obj:`typing.Dict`, :obj:`typing.List`). Technically, :mod:`beartype`
  permissively accepts these factories as unsubscripted type hints to avoid
  raising excessive decoration-time exceptions that most users would consider to
  be ignorable and thus noxious false negatives. Pragmatically, these factories
  are intended to *only* be subscripted by child type hints. Since these
  factories have been deprecated, this debate is largely moot in either case.

sequences, which necessarily satisfy the :class:`collections.abc.Sequence`
protocol with guaranteed :math:`O(1)` indexation across all sequence items).

This set intentionally includes the:

* :data:`.HintSignTuple` sign, identifying variable-length tuple type hints
  subscripted by a single child type hint followed by an ignorable
  :data:`Ellipses` object (i.e., `"..."` substring sans quotes). As such,
  callers should explicitly ignore :data:`Ellipses` objects that are the second
  child type hints subscripting type hints whose signs are in this set.

This set intentionally excludes the:

* :obj:`typing.AnyStr` sign, which accepts only the :class:`str` and
  :class:`bytes` types as its sole subscripted argument, which does *not*
  unconditionally constrain *all* items (i.e., unencoded and encoded characters
  respectively) of compliant sequences but instead parametrizes this attribute.
* :obj:`typing.ByteString` sign, which conditionally accepts either no or an
  arbitrary number of subscripted arguments depending on whether that sign
  identifies:

  * A :pep:`484`-compliant ``typing.ByteString`` type hint subscriptable *no*
    child type hints.
  * A :pep:`585`-compliant ``collections.abc.ByteString[...]`` type hint
    subscriptable by an arbitrary number of child type hints (but typically
    simply :class:`str`).

  Since neither PEP 484 nor 585 comment on ``ByteString`` in detail (or at all,
  really), this non-orthogonality remains inexplicable, frustrating, and utterly
  unsurprising. We elect to merely shrug. In all likelihood, this is an
  ignorable error that no one particularly cares about -- especially since both
  type hint factories have now been scheduled for removal as deprecated.
* :obj:`typing.Deque` sign, whose compliant objects (i.e.,
  :class:`collections.deque` instances) only `guarantee O(n) indexation across
  all sequence items <collections.deque_>`__:

     Indexed access is ``O(1)`` at both ends but slows to ``O(n)`` in the
     middle. For fast random access, use lists instead.

* :obj:`typing.NamedTuple` sign, which embeds a variadic number of
  PEP-compliant field type hints and thus requires special-cased handling.
* :obj:`typing.Text` sign, which accepts *no* subscripted arguments.
  :obj:`typing.Text` is simply an alias for the builtin :class:`str` type and
  thus handled elsewhere as a PEP-noncompliant type hint.
* :data:`.HintSignTupleFixed` sign, identifying fixed-length tuple type hints
  subscripted by an arbitrary number of child type hints and thus requiring
  special-cased handling.

Generator callables are simply syntactic sugar for non-generator callables

annotated as returning a type compatible with generator objects -- including:

* :data:`HintSignGenerator`, the narrowest abstract base class (ABC) to which
  all generator objects necessarily conform.
* :data:`HintSignIterator`, the immediate superclass of
  :data:`HintSignGenerator`.
* :data:`HintSignIterable`, the immediate superclass of
  :data:`HintSignIterator`.

Technically, :pep:`484` states that generator callables may only be annotated
as only returning a subscription of the :obj:`typing.Generator` factory:

    The return type of generator functions can be annotated by the generic type
    ``Generator[yield_type, send_type, return_type]`` provided by ``typing.py``
    module:

Pragmatically, official documentation for the :mod:`typing` module seemingly
*never* standardized by an existing PEP additionally states that generator
callables may be annotated as also returning a subscription of either the
:obj:`typing.Iterable` or :obj:`typing.Iterator` factories:

    Alternatively, annotate your generator as having a return type of either
    ``Iterable[YieldType]`` or ``Iterator[YieldType]``:

  degree that they even intentionally prefix their machine-readable
  representation by the fully-qualified name of the caller's module: e.g.,

  .. code-block:: python

     >>> import typing
     >>> new_type = typing.NewType('List', bool)
     >>> repr(new_type)

  ``typing.Annotated[int, 63]``) such that the value of the ``__module__``
  attributes of these hints is that of that argument rather than their own.
  Oddly, their machine-readable representation remains prefixed by
