    '''
    Reduce the passed **PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array** (i.e.,
    subscription of the third-party :attr:`numpy.typing.NDArray` type hint
    factory) to the equivalent PEP-compliant beartype validator validating
    arbitrary objects be instances of that array type -- which has the
    substantial merit of already being well-supported, well-tested, and
    well-known to generate optimally efficient type-checking by the
    :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

    Technically, beartype could instead explicitly handle typed NumPy arrays
    throughout the codebase. Of course, doing so would yield *no* tangible
    benefits while imposing a considerable maintenance burden.

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing raised exception messages.

    All remaining passed arguments are silently ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        This PEP-noncompliant typed NumPy array reduced to a PEP-compliant type
        hint supported by :mod:`beartype`.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepNumpyException
        If either:

        * The active Python interpreter targets Python < 3.9 and either:

          * The third-party :mod:`typing_extensions` module is unimportable.
          * The third-party :mod:`typing_extensions` module is importable but
            sufficiently old that it fails to declare the
            :attr:`typing_extensions.Annotated` attribute.

        * This hint is a typed NumPy array but either:

          * *Not* subscripted by exactly two arguments.
          * Subscripted by exactly two arguments but whose second argument is
            neither:

            * A **NumPy data type** (i.e., :class:`numpy.dtype` instance).
            * An object coercible into a NumPy data type by passing to the
              :meth:`numpy.dtype.__init__` method.

    # If this hint is the unsubscripted "NDArray" type hint, this hint
    # permissively matches *ALL* NumPy arrays rather than strictly matching
    # *ONLY* appropriately typed NumPy arrays. In this case, reduce this hint
    # to the untyped "numpy.ndarray" class.
    #
    # Note the similar test matching the subscripted "NDArray[Any]" hint below.
    # Moreover, note this test *CANNOT* be performed elsewhere (e.g., by
    # adding "HintSignNumpyArray" to the "HINT_SIGNS_ORIGIN_ISINSTANCEABLE"
    # frozen set of all signs whose unsubscripted type hint factories are
    # shallowly type-checkable). Why? Because the "NDArray" type hint factory
    # violates type hinting standards. Specifically, this factory implicitly
    # subscripts *AND* parametrizes itself with the "numpy.ScalarType" type
    # variable bounded above by the "numpy.generic" abstract base class for
    # NumPy scalars.
    #
    # We have *NO* idea why NumPy does this. This implicit behaviour is
    # semantically lossy rather than lossless and thus arguably constitutes an
    # upstream bug. Why? Because this behaviour violates:
    # * The NumPy API. The "NDArray" type hint factory is subscriptable by more
    #   than merely NumPy scalar types. Ergo, "NDArray" is semantically
    #   inaccurate!
    # * PEP 484, which explicitly standardizes an equivalence between
    #   unsubscripted type hint factories and the same factories subscripted by
    #   the "typing.Any" singleton. However, "NDArray" is *MUCH* semantically
    #   narrower than and thus *NOT* equivalent to "NDArray[Any]"!
    #
    # Of course, upstream is unlikely to see it that way. We're *NOT* dying on
    # an argumentative hill about semantics. Upstream makes the rules. Do it.
