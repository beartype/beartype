#FIXME: coerce_hint() should also rewrite unhashable hints to be hashable *IF
#FEASIBLE.* This isn't always feasible, of course (e.g., "Annotated[[]]",
#"Literal[[]]"). The one notable place where this *IS* feasible is with PEP
#585-compliant type hints subscripted by unhashable rather than hashable
#iterables, which can *ALWAYS* be safely rewritten to be hashable (e.g.,
#coercing "callable[[], None]" to "callable[(), None]").

#FIXME: coerce_hint() should also coerce PEP 544-compatible protocols *NOT*
#decorated by @typing.runtime_checkable to be decorated by that decorator, as
#such protocols are unusable at runtime. Yes, we should always try something
#*REALLY* sneaky and clever.
#
#Specifically, rather than accept "typing" nonsense verbatim, we could instead:
#* Detect PEP 544-compatible protocol type hints *NOT* decorated by
#  @typing.runtime_checkable. The existing is_type_isinstanceable() tester now
#  detects whether arbitrary classes are isinstanceable, so just call that.
#* Emit a non-fatal warning advising the end user to resolve this on their end.
#* Meanwhile, beartype can simply:
#  * Dynamically fabricate a new PEP 544-compatible protocol decorated by
#    @typing.runtime_checkable using the body of the undecorated user-defined
#    protocol as its base. Indeed, simply subclassing a new subclass decorated
#    by @typing.runtime_checkable from the undecorated user-defined protocol as
#    its base with a noop body of "pass" should suffice.
#  * Replacing all instances of the undecorated user-defined protocol with that
#    decorated beartype-defined protocol in annotations. Note this would
#    strongly benefit from some form of memoization or caching. Since this edge
#    case should be fairly rare, even a dictionary would probably be overkill.
#    Just implementing something resembling the following memoized getter
#    in the "utilpep544" submodule would probably suffice:
#        @callable_cached
#        def get_pep544_protocol_checkable_from_protocol_uncheckable(
#            protocol_uncheckable: object) -> Protocol:
#            ...
#
#Checkmate, "typing". Checkmate.

**Type hint cache** (i.e., thread-safe cache mapping from the machine-readable
representations of all non-self-cached type hints to those hints).**

This cache caches:

* :pep:`585`-compliant type hints, which do *not* cache themselves.

This cache does *not* cache:

* Type hints declared by the :mod:`typing` module, which implicitly cache
  themselves on subscription thanks to inscrutable metaclass magic.
* :pep:`563`-compliant **deferred type hints** (i.e., type hints persisted as
  evaluable strings rather than actual type hints). Ideally, this cache would
  cache the evaluations of *all* deferred type hints. Sadly, doing so is
  infeasible in the general case due to global and local namespace lookups
  (e.g., ``Dict[str, int]`` only means what you think it means if an
  importation resembling ``from typing import Dict`` preceded that type hint).

Implementation
--------------
This dictionary is intentionally designed as a naive dictionary rather than
robust LRU cache, for the same reasons that callables accepting hints are
memoized by the :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached`
rather than the :func:`functools.lru_cache` decorator. Why? Because:

* The number of different type hints instantiated across even worst-case
  codebases is negligible in comparison to the space consumed by those hints.
* The :attr:`sys.modules` dictionary persists strong references to all
  callables declared by previously imported modules. In turn, the
  ``func.__annotations__`` dunder dictionary of each such callable persists
  strong references to all type hints annotating that callable. In turn, these
  two statements imply that type hints are *never* garbage collected but
  instead persisted for the lifetime of the active Python process. Ergo,
  temporarily caching hints in an LRU cache is pointless, as there are *no*
  space savings in dropping stale references to unused hints.

    '''
    PEP-compliant type hint sanified (i.e., sanitized) from the passed **root
    type hint** (i.e., possibly PEP-noncompliant type hint annotating the
    parameter or return with the passed name of the passed callable) if this
    hint is reducible *or* this hint as is otherwise (i.e., if this hint is
    irreducible).

    Specifically, this function:

    * If this hint is a **PEP-noncompliant tuple union** (i.e., tuple of one or
      more standard classes and forward references to standard classes):

      * Coerces this tuple union into the equivalent :pep:`484`-compliant

    * Else if this hint is already PEP-compliant, preserves and returns this
      hint unmodified as is.
    * Else (i.e., if this hint is neither PEP-compliant nor -noncompliant and
      thus invalid as a type hint), raise an exception.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Even if this function *could* be
    meaningfully memoized, there would be no benefit; this function is only
    called once per parameter or return of the currently decorated callable.

    This function is intended to be called *after* all possibly
    :pep:`563`-compliant **deferred type hints** (i.e., type hints persisted as
    evaluatable strings rather than actual type hints) annotating this callable
    if any have been evaluated into actual type hints.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Possibly PEP-noncompliant root type hint to be sanified.
    func : Callable
        Callable that this hint directly annotates a parameter or return of.
    pith_name : str
        Either:

        * If this hint annotates a parameter, the name of that parameter.
        * If this hint annotates the return, ``"return"``.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the

    Returns
    ----------

        * If this hint is PEP-noncompliant, a PEP-compliant type hint converted
          from this hint.
        * If this hint is PEP-compliant, this hint unmodified as is.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepException
        If this object is neither:

def _coerce_hint_any(hint: object) -> Any:
    '''
    PEP-compliant type hint coerced (i.e., converted) from the passed
    PEP-compliant type hint if this hint is coercible *or* this hint as is
    otherwise (i.e., if this hint is *not* coercible).

    Specifically, if the passed hint is:

    * A **PEP-compliant uncached type hint** (i.e., hint *not* already
      internally cached by its parent class or module), this function:

      * If this hint has already been passed to a prior call of this function,

        Doing so deduplicates this hint, which both:

        * Minimizes space complexity across the lifetime of this process.
        * Minimizes time complexity by enabling beartype-specific memoized

          same machine-readable representation.

      * Else, internally caches this hint with a thread-safe global cache and
        returns this hint as is.

      Uncached hints include:

      * :pep:`484`-compliant subscripted generics under Python >= 3.9 (e.g.,
        ``from typing import List; class MuhPep484List(List): pass;
        MuhPep484List[int]``). See below for further commentary.
      * :pep:`585`-compliant type hints, including both:

        * Builtin :pep:`585`-compliant type hints (e.g., ``list[int]``).
        * User-defined :pep:`585`-compliant generics (e.g.,
          ``class MuhPep585List(list): pass; MuhPep585List[int]``).

    * Already cached, this hint is already PEP-compliant by definition. In this
      case, this function preserves and returns this hint as is.

    This function is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator). Since the hint returned by this
    function conditionally depends upon the passed callable, memoizing this
    function would consume space needlessly with *no* useful benefit.

    Design
    ------
    This function does *not* bother caching **self-caching type hints** (i.e.,
    type hints that externally cache themselves), as these hints are already
    cached elsewhere. Self-cached type hints include most type hints created by
    subscripting type hint factories declared by the :mod:`typing` module,
    which internally cache their resulting type hints: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: python

       >>> import typing
       >>> typing.List[int] is typing.List[int]
       True

    Equivalently, this function *only* caches **uncached type hints** (i.e.,
    type hints that do *not* externally cache themselves), as these hints are
    *not* already cached elsewhere. Uncached type hints include *all*
    :pep:`585`-compliant type hints produced by subscripting builtin container
    types, which fail to internally cache their resulting type hints: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: python

       >>> list[int] is list[int]
       False

    This function enables callers to coerce uncached type hints into
    :mod:`beartype`-cached type hints. :mod:`beartype` effectively requires
    *all* type hints to be cached somewhere! :mod:`beartype` does *not* care
    who, what, or how is caching those type hints -- only that they are cached
    before being passed to utility functions in the :mod:`beartype` codebase.
    Why? Because most such utility functions are memoized for efficiency by the
    :func:`beartype._util.cache.utilcachecall.callable_cached` decorator, which
    maps passed parameters (typically including the standard ``hint`` parameter
    accepting a type hint) based on object identity to previously cached return
    values. You see the problem, we trust.

    Uncached type hints that are otherwise semantically equal are nonetheless
    distinct objects and will thus be treated as distinct parameters by
    memoization decorators. If this function did *not* exist, uncached type
    hints could *not* be coerced into :mod:`beartype`-cached type hints and
    thus could *not* be memoized, dramatically reducing the efficiency of
    :mod:`beartype` for standard type hints.

    Caveats
    ----------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Since this high-level function
    internally defers to unmemoized low-level functions that are ``O(n)`` in
    ``n`` the size of the inheritance hierarchy of this hint, this function
    should be called sparingly. See the :mod:`beartype._decor._cache.cachehint`
    submodule for further details.

    This function intentionally does *not* cache :pep:`484`-compliant generics
    subscripted by type variables under Python < 3.9. Those hints are
    technically uncached but silently treated by this function as self-cached
    and thus preserved as is. Why? Because correctly detecting those hints as
    uncached would require an unmemoized ``O(n)`` search across the inheritance
    hierarchy of *all* passed objects and thus all type hints annotating
    callables decorated by :func:`beartype.beartype`. Since this failure only
    affects obsolete Python versions *and* since the only harms induced by this
    failure are a slight increase in space and time consumption for edge-case
    type hints unlikely to actually be used in real-world code, this tradeoff
    is more than acceptable. We're not the bad guy here. Right?

    Parameters

    hint : object
        Type hint to be possibly coerced.

def _reduce_hint(hint: Any, exception_prefix: str) -> object:
    '''
    Lower-level type hint reduced (i.e., converted) from the passed
    higher-level type hint if this hint is reducible *or* this hint as is
    otherwise (i.e., if this hint is irreducible).

    Specifically, if the passed hint is:

    * *Not* PEP-compliant, this hint is returned as is unmodified.
    * PEP 593-compliant (i.e., :class:`typing.Annotated`) but beartype-agnostic
      (i.e., its second argument is *not* an instance of the
      :class:`beartype.vale._core._valecore.BeartypeValidator` class produced by
      subscripting the :class:`beartype.vale.Is` class), this hint is reduced
      to the first argument subscripting this hint. Doing so ignores *all*
      irrelevant annotations on this hint (e.g., reducing
      ``typing.Annotated[str, 50, False]`` to simply ``str``).

    This function is memoized for efficiency.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Any
        Type hint to be possibly reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message.

    Returns
    ----------
    object
        Either:

        * If the passed higher-level type hint is reducible, a lower-level type
          hint reduced (i.e., converted, extracted) from this hint.
        * Else, this hint as is unmodified.

    Raises
    ----------
