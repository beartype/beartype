    ``True`` only if the passed object is a C-based `PEP 585`_-compliant **type
    hint** (i.e., C-based type hint instantiated by subscripting either a
    concrete builtin container class like :class:`list` or :class:`tuple` *or*
    an abstract base class (ABC) declared by the :mod:`collections.abc`
    submodule like :class:`collections.abc.Iterable` or
    :class:`collections.abc.Sequence`).

    This tester is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This test returns false for** `PEP 585`_-compliant **generics,** which
    fail to satisfy the same API as all other `PEP 585`_-compliant type hints.
    Why? Because `PEP 560`_-type erasure erases this API on `PEP
    585`_-compliant generics immediately after those generics are declared,
    preventing their subsequent detection as `PEP 585`_-compliant. Instead,
    `PEP 585`_-compliant generics are only detectable by calling either:

    * The high-level PEP-agnostic
      :func:`beartype._util.hint.pep.utilhintpeptest.is_hint_pep_generic`
      tester.
    * The low-level `PEP 585`_-specific :func:`is_hint_pep585_generic` tester.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is a `PEP 585`_-compliant type hint.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This non-memoized function should only be called at a sufficiently early
    time during** :mod:`beartype` **decoration,** when the passed object cannot
    be guaranteed to have already been cached somewhere. Since this is
    typically *not* the case, the memoized :func:`is_hint_pep585_generic`
    function wrapping this function should typically be called instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Possibly non-cached object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is a `PEP 585`_-compliant generic.

def get_hint_pep585_generic_typevars(hint: object) -> 'Tuple[TypeVar, ...]':
    '''
    Tuple of all **unique type variables** (i.e., subscripted :class:`TypeVar`

    at hint declaration time ignoring duplicates) if any *or* the empty tuple
    otherwise.

    This getter is memoized for efficiency.

    Motivation
    ----------
    The current implementation of `PEP 585`_ under at least Python 3.9 is
    fundamentally broken with respect to parametrized generics. While `PEP
    484`_-compliant generics properly propagate type variables from
    pseudo-superclasses to subclasses, `PEP 585`_ fails to do so. This function
    "fills in the gaps" by recovering these type variables from parametrized
    `PEP 585`_-compliant generics by iteratively constructing a new tuple from
    the type variables parametrizing all pseudo-superclasses of this generic.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    Tuple[TypeVar]
        Either:

        * If this `PEP 585`_-compliant generic defines a ``__parameters__``
          dunder attribute, the value of that attribute.
        * Else, the empty tuple.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep585Exception
