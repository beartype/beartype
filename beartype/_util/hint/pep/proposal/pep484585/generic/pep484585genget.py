    '''
    Tuple of the one or more **full child type hints** (i.e., complete tuple of
    *all* type hints directly subscripting both the passed generic *and*
    one or more pseudo-superclasses of this generic) transitively subscripting
    the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant **generic** (i.e., class
    superficially subclassing at least one PEP-compliant type hint that is
    possibly *not* an actual class) if this object is a generic *or* raise an
    exception otherwise (i.e., if this object is not a generic).

    This getter greedily replaces in the passed tuple as many abstract
    :pep:`484`-compliant **type variables** (i.e., :class:`typing.TypeVar`
    objects) as there are concrete child type hints directly subscripting the
    passed generic. Doing so effectively "bubbles up" these concrete children up
    the class hierarchy into the "empty placeholders" established by the type
    variables transitively subscripting all pseudo-superclasses of this generic.

    This getter is guaranteed to return a non-empty tuple. By definition, a
    generic subclasses one or more generic superclasses necessarily subscripted
    by one or more child type hints.

    This getter is memoized for efficiency.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This getter is computationally complex in both space and time.** This
    getter exhibits:

    * Amortized :math:`O(1)` constant time complexity, thanks to memoization.
    * Non-amortized worst-case :math:`O(jk)` quadratic time complexity for:

      * :math:`j` the largest number of child type hints transitively
        subscripting a pseudo-superclass of this generic.
      * :math:`k` the total number of transitive pseudo-superclasses of this
        generic.

    **This getter is currently implemented with recursion.** Doing so yields a
    relatively trivial algorithm at a relatively non-trivial increase in runtime
    overhead, due to overhead associated with function calls in Python.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Generic type hint to be inspected.
    hint_base_target : Optional[Hint] = None
        **Target pseudo-superclass** (i.e., erased transitive pseudo-superclass
        of the passed generic to specifically search, filter, and return the
        child type hints of). Defaults to :data:`None`. Specifically:

        * If this parameter is :data:`None`, this getter returns the complete
          tuple of *all* type hints directly subscripting both the passed
          generic *and* one or more pseudo-superclasses of this generic.
        * If this parameter is *not* :data:`None`, this getter returns the
          partial tuple of *only* type hints directly subscripting both the
          passed generic *and* this passed pseudo-superclass of this generic.

        A target pseudo-superclass is passed to deduce whether two generics are
        related according to the :func:`beartype.door.is_subhint` relation. If
        all child type hints in the tuple returned by this getter (when passed
        some generic and its pseudo-superclass) are subhints of all child type
        hints in the tuple returned by this getter passed *only* that
        pseudo-superclass, then that generic is necessarily a subhint of that
        pseudo-superclass. Look. Just go with it, people.

        Lastly, note that this getter intentionally ignores *all* child hints
        subscripting this target pseudo-superclass. For search purposes, *any*
        child hints subscripting this target pseudo-superclass are not only
        irrelevant but harmful -- promoting false negatives in higher-level
        functions (e.g., :func:`beartype.door.is_subhint`) internally leveraging
        this lower-level getter. Ignoring these child hints is thus imperative.
        Since deciding child hint compatibility between the passed generic and
        this target pseudo-superclass is a non-trivial decision problem, this
        lower-level getter defers that problem to the caller by unconditionally
        returning the same result regardless of child hints subscripting this
        target pseudo-superclass.

        For example, consider the :pep:`484`-compliant :obj:`typing.Any`.
        Clearly, this getter should return the same tuple when passed an
        unsubscripted target pseudo-superclass as when passed a target
        pseudo-superclass subscripted by :obj:`typing.Any`: e.g.,

        .. code-block:: pycon

           >>> from typing import Any, Generic
           >>> class MuhGeneric[S, T](Generic[S, T]): pass
           >>> get_hint_pep484585_generic_args_full(
           ...     MuhGeneric, hint_base_target=Generic)

           >>> get_hint_pep484585_generic_args_full(
           ...     MuhGeneric, hint_base_target=Generic[Any])

           >>> get_hint_pep484585_generic_args_full(

           >>> get_hint_pep484585_generic_args_full(
           ...     MuhGeneric, hint_base_target=Generic[int, float])
           (S, T)

    exception_cls : TypeException
        Type of exception to be raised. Defaults to
        :exc:`.BeartypeDecorHintPep484585Exception`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing the representation of this object in
        the exception message. Defaults to the empty string.

    Returns
    -------
    Tuple[Hint, ...]
        Tuple of the one or more full child type hints transitively subscripting
        this generic.

    Raises
    ------
    exception_cls
        If this hint is either:

        * Neither a :pep:`484`- nor :pep:`585`-compliant generic.
        * A :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant generic subclassing *no*
          pseudo-superclasses.

    Tuple of the one or more **unerased pseudo-superclasses** (i.e.,
    PEP-compliant objects originally listed as superclasses prior to their
    implicit type erasure under :pep:`560`) of the passed :pep:`484`- or
    :pep:`585`-compliant **generic** (i.e., class superficially subclassing at
    least one PEP-compliant type hint that is possibly *not* an actual class) if
    this object is a generic *or* raise an exception otherwise (i.e., if this
    object is *not* a generic).

    This getter is guaranteed to return a non-empty tuple. By definition, a
    generic is a type subclassing one or more generic superclasses.

    This getter is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This getter should always be called in lieu of attempting to directly
    access the low-level** ``__orig_bases__`` **dunder instance variable.**
    Most PEP-compliant type hints fail to declare that variable, guaranteeing
    :class:`AttributeError` exceptions from all general-purpose logic
    attempting to directly access that variable. Thus this function, which
    "fills in the gaps" by implementing this oversight.

    **This getter returns tuples possibly containing a mixture of actual
    superclasses and pseudo-superclasses superficially masquerading as actual
    superclasses subscripted by one or more PEP-compliant child hints or type
    variables** (e.g., ``(typing.Iterable[T], typing.Sized[T])``). Indeed, most
    type hints used as superclasses produced by subscripting PEP-compliant type
    hint factories are *not* actually types but singleton objects devilishly
    masquerading as types. Most actual :mod:`typing` superclasses are private,
    fragile, and prone to alteration or even removal between Python versions.

    Motivation
    ----------
    :pep:`560` (i.e., "Core support for typing module and generic types)
    formalizes the ``__orig_bases__`` dunder attribute first informally
    introduced by the :mod:`typing` module's implementation of :pep:`484`.
    Naturally, :pep:`560` remains as unusable as :pep:`484` itself. Ideally,
    :pep:`560` would have generalized the core intention of preserving each
    original user-specified subclass tuple of superclasses as a full-blown
    ``__orig_mro__`` dunder attribute listing the original method resolution
    order (MRO) of that subclass had that tuple *not* been modified.

    Naturally, :pep:`560` did no such thing. The original MRO remains obfuscated
    and effectively inaccessible. While computing that MRO would technically be
    feasible, doing so would also be highly non-trivial, expensive, and fragile.
    Instead, this function retrieves *only* the tuple of :mod:`typing`-specific
    pseudo-superclasses that this object's class originally attempted (but
    failed) to subclass.

    You are probably now agitatedly cogitating to yourself in the darkness: "But
    @leycec: what do you mean :pep:`560`? Wasn't :pep:`560` released *after*
    :pep:`484`? Surely no public API defined by the Python stdlib would be so
    malicious as to silently alter the tuple of base classes listed by a
    user-defined subclass?"

    As we've established both above and elsewhere throughout the codebase,
    everything developed for :pep:`484` -- including :pep:`560`, which derives
    its entire raison d'etre from :pep:`484` -- are fundamentally insane. In
    this case, :pep:`484` is insane by subjecting parametrized :mod:`typing`
    types employed as base classes to "type erasure," because:

         ...it is common practice in languages with generics (e.g. Java,
         TypeScript).

    Since Java and TypeScript are both terrible languages, blindly
    recapitulating bad mistakes baked into such languages is an equally bad
    mistake. In this case, "type erasure" means that the :mod:`typing` module
    *intentionally* destroys runtime type information for nebulous and largely
    unjustifiable reasons (i.e., Big Daddy Java and TypeScript do it, so it
    must be unquestionably good).

    Specifically, the :mod:`typing` module intentionally munges :mod:`typing`
    types listed as base classes in user-defined subclasses as follows:

    * All base classes whose origin is a builtin container (e.g.,
      ``typing.List[T]``) are reduced to that container (e.g., :class:`list`).
    * All base classes derived from an abstract base class declared by the
      :mod:`collections.abc` subpackage (e.g., ``typing.Iterable[T]``) are
      reduced to that abstract base class (e.g., ``collections.abc.Iterable``).
    * All surviving base classes that are parametrized (e.g.,
      ``typing.Generic[S, T]``) are stripped of that parametrization (e.g.,
      :class:`typing.Generic`).

    Since there exists no counterpart to the :class:`typing.Generic` superclass,
    the :mod:`typing` module preserves that superclass in unparametrized form.
    Naturally, this is useless, as an unparametrized :class:`typing.Generic`
    superclass conveys no meaningful type information. All other superclasses
    are reduced to their non-:mod:`typing` counterparts: e.g.,

        .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Iterable, List
        >>> T = TypeVar('T')
        >>> class UserDefinedGeneric(List[T], Iterable[T], Generic[T]): pass
        # This is type erasure.
        >>> UserDefinedGeneric.__mro__
        (list, collections.abc.Iterable, Generic)
        # This is type preservation -- except the original MRO is discarded.
        # So, it's not preservation; it's reduction! We take what we can get.
        >>> UserDefinedGeneric.__orig_bases__
        (typing.List[T], typing.Iterable[T], typing.Generic[T])
        # Guess which we prefer?

    So, we prefer the generally useful ``__orig_bases__`` dunder tuple over the
    generally useless ``__mro__`` dunder tuple. Note, however, that the latter
    *is* still occasionally useful and thus occasionally returned by this
    getter. For inexplicable reasons, **single-inherited protocols** (i.e.,
    classes directly subclassing *only* the :pep:`544`-compliant
    :attr:`typing.Protocol` abstract base class (ABC)) are *not* subject to type
    erasure and thus constitute a notable exception to this heuristic:

        .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from typing import Protocol
        >>> class UserDefinedProtocol(Protocol): pass
        >>> UserDefinedProtocol.__mro__
        (__main__.UserDefinedProtocol, typing.Protocol, typing.Generic, object)
        >>> UserDefinedProtocol.__orig_bases__
        AttributeError: type object 'UserDefinedProtocol' has no attribute
        '__orig_bases__'

    Welcome to :mod:`typing` hell, where even :mod:`typing` types lie broken and
    misshapen on the killing floor of overzealous theory-crafting purists.

    * Is (currently) unnecessary, as all callers of this function are themselves

    Motivation
    ----------
    This finder is typically called to reduce **descriptive generics** (i.e.,
    generics defined in third-party packages intended to be used *only* as
    descriptive type hints rather than actually instantiated as objects as most
    generics are) to the isinstanceable classes those generics describe.

    proliferation of descriptive generics leaves :mod:`beartype` with little
    choice but to grin wanly and bear the pain they subject us to. As example,
    this finder is currently called elsewhere to:

    * Reduce Pandera type hints (e.g., `pandera.typing.DataFrame[...]`) to the
      Pandas types they describe (e.g., `pandas.DataFrame`).
    * Reduce NumPy type hints (e.g., `numpy.typing.NDArray[...]`) to the
      NumPy types they describe (e.g., `numpy.ndarray`).

    See examples below for further discussion.

    Parameters

    hint : Hint
        Generic type hint to be inspected.
    module_name : str
        Fully-qualified name of the third-party package or module to find the
        first class in this generic type hint of.
    exception_cls : TypeException
        Type of exception to be raised. Defaults to

    Either the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant **generic** (i.e.,
    class superficially subclassing at least one PEP-compliant type hint that is
    possibly *not* an actual class) if **unsubscripted** (i.e., indexed by *no*
    arguments or type variables), the unsubscripted generic underlying this
    generic if **subscripted** (i.e., indexed by one or more child type hints
    and/or type variables), *or* raise an exception otherwise (i.e., if this
    hint is *not* a generic).

    Specifically, this getter returns (in order):

    * If this hint originates from an **origin type** (i.e., isinstanceable
      class such that *all* objects satisfying this hint are instances of that
      class), this type regardless of whether this hint is already a class.
    * Else if this hint is already a class, this hint as is.
    * Else, raise an exception.

    This getter is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This getter returns false positives in edge cases.** That is, this getter
    returns non-:data:`None` values for both generics and non-generics --
    notably, non-generics defining the ``__origin__`` dunder attribute to an
    isinstanceable class. Callers *must* perform subsequent tests to distinguish
    these two cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Generic type hint to be inspected.
    exception_cls : TypeException
        Type of exception to be raised. Defaults to
        :exc:`BeartypeDecorHintPep484585Exception`.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing the representation of this object in
        the exception message. Defaults to the empty string.

    Returns
    -------
    type
        Class originating this generic.

    Raises
    ------
    exception_cls
        If this hint is *not* a generic.
