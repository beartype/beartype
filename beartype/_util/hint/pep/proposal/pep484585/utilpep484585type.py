#        so here dramatically simplifies matters elsewhere.
#      * This reduction *CANNOT* be performed by the is_hint_ignorable() tester,
#        as subclass type hints subscripted by ignorable child type hints are
#        *NOT* ignorable; they're reducible to the "type" superclass."

# Clearly, we should have documented that here as well. Examine closer, please.

    '''
    Reduce the passed :pep:`484`- or :pep:`585`-compliant **subclass type
    hint** (i.e., hint constraining objects to subclass that superclass) to the
    :class:`type` superclass if that hint is subscripted by an ignorable child
    type hint (e.g., :attr:`typing.Any`, :class:`type`) *or* preserve this hint
    as is otherwise (i.e., if that hint is *not* subscripted by an ignorable
    child type hint).

    This reducer is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as reducers cannot be memoized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Subclass type hint to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message.

    All remaining passed arguments are silently ignored.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep484585Exception
        If this hint is neither a :pep:`484`- nor :pep:`585`-compliant subclass
        type hint.
