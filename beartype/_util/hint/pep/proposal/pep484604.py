    Raise an exception if the passed object is a :pep:`604`-compliant
    **inconsistent type hint** (i.e., object permissible as an item of a
    :pep:`604`-compliant new union whose machine-readable representation is
    *not* the machine-readable representation of this hint in new unions).

    Motivation
    ----------
    This raiser protects the :mod:`beartype` codebase against inconsistencies in
    poorly implemented third-party type hints whose **machine-readable
    representations** (i.e., strings returned by passing those hints to the
    :func:`repr` builtin) differ from their representations in new unions
    containing those hints.

    Ideally, *no* such inconsistencies would ever exist. For unknown reasons,
    some third-party type hints induce such inconsistencies. :mod:`nptyping` is
    the canonical example. Type hint factories published by :mod:`nptyping`
    dynamically create in-memory classes all sharing the same fully-qualified
    names despite being distinct classes. Ye who code, grok and weep: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: pycon

       # Define two typical "nptyping" type hints.
       >>> from nptyping import Float64, NDArray, Shape
       >>> foo = NDArray[Shape["N, N"], Float64]
       >>> bar = NDArray[Shape["*"], Float64]

       >>> repr(foo)
       NDArray[Shape["N, N"], Float64]  # <-- this is sane
       >>> repr(bar)
       NDArray[Shape["*"], Float64]  # <-- this is sane, too

       >>> foo == bar
       False    # <-- still sane
       >>> foo.__name__
       NDArray  # <-- this is insane
       >>> bar.__name__
       NDArray  # <-- still insane after all these years

       >>> foo | None == bar | None
       False           # <-- back to sane
       >>> repr(foo | None)
       NDArray | None  # <-- big yikes
       >>> repr(bar | None)
       NDArray | None  # <-- yikes intensifies

    ``foo`` and ``bar`` are distinct type hints matching different NumPy arrays;
    their representations are likewise distinct. The new unions of those hints
    with :data:`None` are also distinct type hints; nonetheless, the
    representations of those new unions **are the exact same.**

    This raiser detects this inconsistency by raising an exception from the
    :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator. If we failed to do so, then
    :func:`beartype.beartype` would behave non-deterministically when presented
    with such hints. Consider the following decoration:

    .. code-block:: python

       @beartype
       def bad_func(first_array: foo | None, second_array: bar | None) -> None:
           ...

    Given that decoration, :func:`beartype.beartype` would (in order):

    #. Cache the first new union ``foo | None`` under the string representation
       ``"NDArray | None"``.
    #. Erroneously replace the second new union ``bar | None`` with the
       previously cached new union ``foo | None``. Why? Because those two new
       unions share the same representations. From the limited perspective of
       :mod:`beartype`, those two new unions are effectively the same new union
       and thus can be safely de-duplicated. *This is why we facepalm.*

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be inspected.

    Raises
    ------
    bool
        :data:`True` only if this object is a :pep:`604`-compliant union.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be inspected.

def make_hint_pep484604_union(hint_childs: SequenceHints) -> Hint:
    '''
    :pep:`604`- or :pep:`484`-compliant union type hint synthesized from the
    passed sequence of two or more PEP-compliant type hints if this sequence
    contains two or more items, the one PEP-compliant type hint in this sequence
    if this sequence contains only one item, *or* raise an exception otherwise
    (i.e., if this sequence is empty).

    This factory preferentially creates and returns (in descending order of
    preference):

    * If *all* of the items in the passed sequence are valid items of a
      :pep:`604`-compliant **new-style union** (``|``-delimited union of two or
      more types under Python >= 3.10), that union of these items.
    * Else, a :pep:`484`-compliant **old-style union** (i.e.,
      :obj:`typing.Union` subscription) of these items.

    This factory is memoized for efficiency. Technically, the
    :attr:`typing.Union` type hint factory already caches its subscripted
    arguments. Pragmatically, that caching is slow and thus worth optimizing
    with trivial optimization on our end. Moreover, this factory is called by
    the performance-sensitive
    :func:`beartype._check.convert._convcoerce.coerce_hint_any` coercer in an
    early-time code path of the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator. Optimizing
    this factory thus optimizes :func:`beartype.beartype` itself. Even more
    importantly, :pep:`604`-compliant new-style unions are *not* self-caching:

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> int | bool is int | bool
       False  # <-- *BIG YIKES*

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint_childs : SequenceHints
        Sequence of all child type hints to be unioned together.

    Returns
    -------
    Hint
        Either:

        * If this sequence contains two or more items, the union type hint
          synthesized from these items.
        * If this sequence contains only one item, this item as is.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep604Exception
        If this sequence is empty.
