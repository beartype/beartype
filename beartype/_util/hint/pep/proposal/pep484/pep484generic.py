    #   (ABC) regardless of whether those classes did so explicitly. How? By
    #   type erasure, of course, the malignant gift that keeps on giving:

    #   be circumventable by observing that this ABC is expected to reside
    #   at the second-to-last index of the tuple exposing this MRO far all
    #   generics by virtue of fragile implementation details violating
    #   privacy encapsulation. In practice, this codebase is already

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint

    -------
    tuple
        Tuple of the one or more unerased pseudo-superclasses of this
        :mod:`typing` generic. Specifically:

        * If this generic defines an ``__orig_bases__`` dunder instance
          variable, the value of that variable as is.

    Raises
    ------
    exception_cls
        If this hint is either:

        * *Not* a :mod:`typing` generic.
        * A :mod:`typing` generic that erased *none* of its superclasses but
          whose method resolution order (MRO) lists strictly less than four
          classes. Valid :pep:`484`-compliant generics should list at least
          four classes, including (in order):

          #. The :class:`typing.Generic` superclass.
          #. The zero or more non-:mod:`typing` superclasses subsequently
