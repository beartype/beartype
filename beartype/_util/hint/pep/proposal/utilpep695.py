# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Consider generalizing @beartype's PEP 695 implementation to additionally
#support local type aliases (i.e., defined in the local scope of a callable
#rather than at global scope) containing one or more unquoted forward
#references. Currently, @beartype intentionally fails to support this: e.g.,
#    type global_alias = ...
#    die_if_unbearable('lolwut', global_alias)  # <-- this is fine
#
#    def muh_func(...) -> ...:
#        type local_alias = ...
#        die_if_unbearable('lolwut', local_alias)  # <-- raises an exception
#
#The reasons are obscure. Very well. CPython's current implementation of local
#type aliases is probably very buggy. An upstream issue describing this
#bugginess should be submitted. When doing so, please publicly declare that PEP
#695 appears to have been poorly tested. As evidence, note that PEP 695 itself
#advises use of the following idiom:
#    # A type alias that includes a forward reference
#    type AnimalOrVegetable = Animal | "Vegetable"
#
#*THAT DOES NOT ACTUALLY WORK AT RUNTIME.* Nobody tested that. This is why I
#facepalm. Notably, PEP 604-compliant new-style unions prohibit strings. They
#probably shouldn't, but they've *ALWAYS* behaved that way, and nobody's updated
#them to behave more intelligently -- probably because doing so would require
#updating the isinstance() builtin (which also accepts PEP 604-compliant
#new-style unions) to behave more intelligiently and ain't nobody goin' there:
#e.g.,
#
#    $ python3.12
#    >>> type AnimalOrVegetable = "Animal" | "Vegetable"
#    >>> AnimalOrVegetable.__value__
#    Traceback (most recent call last):
#      Cell In[3], line 1
#        AnimalOrVegetable.__value__
#      Cell In[2], line 1 in AnimalOrVegetable
#        type AnimalOrVegetable = "Animal" | "Vegetable"
#    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'str' and 'str'
#
#For further details, see the comment below prefixed by:
#           # If that module fails to define this alias as a global variable,
#
#Since CPython is unlikely to resolve its bugginess anytime soon, it inevitably
#falls to @beartype to resolve this. Thankfully, @beartype *CAN* resolve this.
#Unthankfully, doing so will require @beartype to implement a new PEP
#695-specific AST transform from the "beartype.claw" subpackage augmenting *ALL*
#PEP 695-compliant local type aliases (so, probably *ALL* type aliases
#regardless of scope for simplicity) as follows:
#    # "beartype.claw" should transform this...
#    type {alias_name} = {alias_value}
#
#    # ...into this.

#        # If the current scope is module scope, prefer an efficient
#        # non-exec()-based solution. Note that this optimization does *NOT*
#        # generalize to other scopes, for obscure reasons delineated here:

#    #FIXME: Technically, this *ONLY* needs to be done if the
#    #iter_hint_pep695_forwardrefs() iterator returned something. *shrug*
#    # Intentionally redefine this alias. Although this appears to be an
#    # inefficient noop, this is in fact an essential operation. Why?
#    # Because the prior successful access of the "__value__" dunder
#    # variable silently cached and thus froze the value of this alias.
#    # However, alias values are *NOT* necessarily safely freezable at
#    # alias definition time. The canonical example of alias values that
#    # are *NOT* safely freezable at alias definition time are mutually
#    # recursive aliases (i.e., aliases whose values circularly refer to
#    # one another): e.g.,
#    #     type a = b
#    #     type b = a
#    #
#    # PEP 695 provides no explicit means of uncaching alias values.
#    # Our only recourse is to repetitiously redefine this alias.
#    type {alias_name} = {alias_value}
#
#We're currently unclear whether anyone actually cares about this. Ergo, we
#adopted the quick-and-dirty approach of raising exceptions instead. Yikes!

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Type alias to be reduced.
    exception_prefix : str
        Human-readable substring prefixing exception messages raised by this
        reducer.

    All remaining passed arguments are silently ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    object
        Underlying type hint lazily referred to by this type alias.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPep695Exception
        If this type alias contains one or more unquoted relative forward
        references to undefined attributes. Note that this *only* occurs when
        callers avoid beartype import hooks in favour of manually decorating
        callables and classes with the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.
