#FIXME: Refactor is_hint_pep_supported() and die_unless_hint_pep_supported() to
#explicitly reject (with a human-readable exception in the latter case) PEP
#544-compatible protocols *NOT* decorated by @typing.runtime_checkable, as such
#PEP-compliant type hints are unusable at runtime.
#
#Alternately, we could always try something *REAL* sneaky and clever:
#basically, rather than accept "typing" nonsense verbatim, we could instead:
#* Detect PEP 544-compatible protocol type hints *NOT* decorated by
#  @typing.runtime_checkable.
#* Emit a non-fatal warning advising the end user to resolve this on their end.
#* Meanwhile, beartype can simply:
#  * Dynamically fabricate a new PEP 544-compatible protocol decorated by
#    @typing.runtime_checkable using the body of the undecorated user-defined
#    protocol as its base. Indeed, simply subclassing a new subclass decorated
#    by @typing.runtime_checkable from the undecorated user-defined protocol as
#    its base with a noop body of "pass" should suffice.
#  * Replacing all instances of the undecorated user-defined protocol with that
#    decorated beartype-defined protocol in annotations. Note this would
#    strongly benefit from some form of memoization or caching. Since this edge
#    case should be fairly rare, even a dictionary would probably be overkill.
#    Just implementing something resembling the following memoized getter
#    in the "utilhintpep544" submodule would probably suffice:
#        @callable_cached
#        def get_pep544_protocol_checkable_from_protocol_uncheckable(
#            protocol_uncheckable: object) -> Protocol:
#            ...
#
#Checkmate, "typing". Checkmate.

    Raise an exception if the passed object is a **PEP-compliant unsupported

    This validator is effectively (but technically *not*) memoized. See the
    :func:`beartype._util.hint.utilhinttest.die_unless_hint` validator.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function should never be called to validate either signs or
    unsubscripted** :mod:`typing` **objects** (e.g., those returned by the
    :func:`beartype._util.hint.pep.get_hint_pep_sign` function). The
    :func:`die_if_hint_pep_sign_unsupported` function should be called
    instead. Why? Because the :mod:`typing` module implicitly parametrizes
    these attributes by one or more type variables. Since this decorator
    currently fails to support type variables, this function unconditionally
    raises an exception when passed these attributes.

    **This validator only shallowly validates this object.** If this object is
    a subscripted PEP-compliant type hint (e.g., ``Union[str, List[int]]``),
    this validator ignores all subscripted arguments (e.g., ``List[int]``) on
    this hint and may thus return false positives for hints that are directly
    supported but whose subscripted arguments are not. To deeply validate this
    object, iteratively call this validator during a recursive traversal (such
    as a breadth-first search) over each subscripted argument of this object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be validated.
    hint_label : Optional[str]
        Human-readable label prefixing this object's representation in the
        exception message raised by this function. Defaults to ``"Annotated"``.

    ``True`` only if the passed object is a **PEP-compliant type hint** (i.e.,
    object either directly defined by the :mod:`typing` module *or* whose type
    subclasses one or more classes directly defined by the :mod:`typing`
    module).

    This tester is memoized for efficiency.

    Motivation
    ----------
    Standard Python types allow callers to test for compliance with protocols,
    interfaces, and abstract base classes by calling either the
    :func:`isinstance` or :func:`issubclass` builtins. This is the
    well-established Pythonic standard for deciding conformance to an API.

    Insanely, `PEP 484`_ *and* the :mod:`typing` module implementing `PEP 484`_
    reject community standards by explicitly preventing callers from calling
    either the :func:`isinstance` or :func:`issubclass` builtins on most but
    *not* all `PEP 484`_ objects and types. Moreover, neither `PEP 484`_ nor
    :mod:`typing` implement public APIs for testing whether arbitrary objects
    comply with `PEP 484`_ or :mod:`typing`.

    Thus this function, which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this
    laughably critical oversight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object

    Returns

    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Since this high-level function
    internally defers to unmemoized low-level functions that are ``O(n)`` in
    ``n`` the size of the inheritance hierarchy , this function should be

        If this object is a deeply ignorable PEP-compliant type hint. Why?
        Because deeply ignorable PEP-compliant type hints convey *no*
        meaningful semantics but superficially appear to do so. Consider
        ``Union[str, List[int], NewType('MetaType', Annotated[object, 53])]``,
        for example; this PEP-compliant type hint effectively reduces to
        ``typing.Any`` and thus conveys *no* meaningful semantics despite
        superficially appearing to do so.

    **This tester only shallowly inspects this object.** If this object is a

        #   dunder methods fail to comply with the non-standard implemented by
        #   their sibling types. This includes the common "TypeVar" type.

    Since type variables are not themselves types but rather placeholders
    dynamically replaced with types by type checkers according to various
    arcane heuristics, both type variables and types parametrized by type
    variables warrant special-purpose handling.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is a type variable.

    .. _PEP 484:
       https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484
    '''

    # Return true only if the type of this hint is that of all type variables.
    #
    # Note that the "typing.TypeVar" class prohibits subclassing: e.g.,
    #     >>> import typing as t
    #     >>> class MutTypeVar(t.TypeVar): pass
    #     TypeError: Cannot subclass special typing classes
    #
    # Ergo, the object identity test performed here both suffices and is more
    # efficient than the equivalent general-purpose test, which requires an
    # implicit breadth- or depth-first search over the method resolution order
    # (MRO) of all superclasses of this object: e.g.,
    #     # This is potentially *MUCH* slower. It's the little things in life.
    #     return isinstance(hint, TypeVar)
    return hint.__class__ is TypeVar


def is_hint_pep_typevared(hint: object) -> bool:
    '''
    ``True`` only if the passed object is a PEP-compliant type hint
    parametrized by one or more **type variables** (i.e., instances of the
    :class:`TypeVar` class).

    This tester detects both:

    * **Direct parametrizations** (i.e., cases in which this object itself is
      directly parametrized by type variables).
    * **Superclass parametrizations** (i.e., cases in which this object is
      indirectly parametrized by one or more superclasses of its class being
      directly parametrized by type variables).

    This tester is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Semantics
    ----------
    **Generics** (i.e., PEP-compliant type hints whose classes subclass one or
    more public :mod:`typing` pseudo-superclasses) are often but *not* always
    typevared. For example, consider the untypevared generic:

        >>> from typing import List
        >>> class UntypevaredGeneric(List[int]): pass
        >>> UntypevaredGeneric.__mro__
        (__main__.UntypevaredGeneric, list, typing.Generic, object)
        >>> UntypevaredGeneric.__parameters__
        ()

    Likewise, typevared hints are often but *not* always generic. For example,
    consider the typevared non-generic:

        >>> from typing import List, TypeVar
        >>> TypevaredNongeneric = List[TypeVar('T')]
        >>> type(TypevaredNongeneric).__mro__
        (typing._GenericAlias, typing._Final, object)
        >>> TypevaredNongeneric.__parameters__
        (~T,)

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this object is a PEP-compliant type hint parametrized
        by one or more type variables.

    Examples
    ----------
        >>> import typing
        >>> from beartype._util.hint.pep.utilhintpeptest import (
        ...     is_hint_pep_typevared)
        >>> T = typing.TypeVar('T')
        >>> class UserList(typing.List[T]): pass
        # Unparametrized type hint.
        >>> is_hint_pep_typevared(typing.List[int])
        False
        # Directly parametrized type hint.
        >>> is_hint_pep_typevared(typing.List[T])
        True
        # Superclass-parametrized type hint.
        >>> is_hint_pep_typevared(UserList)
        True
