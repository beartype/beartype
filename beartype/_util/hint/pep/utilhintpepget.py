Dictionary mapping from **bad typing names** (i.e., substrings following the
``typing.`` prefix of strings returned by the ``__repr__()`` dunder methods of
:mod:`typing` attributes that erroneously refer to non-existing :mod:`typing`
attributes) to **good typing names** (i.e., the corresponding substrings that
correctly refer to non-existing :mod:`typing` attributes).

For example, under at least Python <= 3.9 (and possibly newer Python versions),
the ``__repr__()`` dunder method of the :attr:`typing.ContextManager` attribute
erroneously returns the string ``typing.AbstractContextManager`` referring to a
non-existing ``typing.AbstractContextManager`` attribute; instead, that method
should ideally return the string ``typing.ContextManager`` referring to the
existing :attr:`typing.ContextManager` attribute. Ergo, this dictionary
contains a key-value pair mapping from the non-existing :mod:`typing` attribute
``AbstractContextManager`` to the existing :mod:`typing` attribute
``ContextManager``.

def get_hint_pep_sign(hint: object) -> dict:
    '''
    **Sign** (i.e., arbitrary object) uniquely identifying the passed
    PEP-compliant type hint if this hint is PEP-compliant *or* raise an
    exception otherwise (i.e., if this hint is *not* PEP-compliant).

    This getter function associates the passed hint with a public attribute of
    the :mod:`typing` module effectively acting as a superclass of this hint
    and thus uniquely identifying the "type" of this hint in the broadest sense
    of the term "type". These attributes are typically *not* actual types, as
    most actual :mod:`typing` types are private, fragile, and prone to extreme
    violation (or even removal) between major Python versions. Nonetheless,
    these attributes are sufficiently unique to enable callers to distinguish
    between numerous broad categories of :mod:`typing` behaviour and logic.

    Specifically, this function returns either:

    * If this hint is a `PEP 585`_-compliant **builtin** (e.g., C-based type
      hint instantiated by subscripting either a concrete builtin container
      class like :class:`list` or :class:`tuple` *or* an abstract base class
      (ABC) declared by the :mod:`collections.abc` submodule like
      :class:`collections.abc.Iterable` or :class:`collections.abc.Sequence`),
      :class:`beartype.cave.HintPep585Type`.
    * If this hint is a **generic** (i.e., subclasses of the
      :class:`typing.Generic` abstract base class (ABC)),
      :class:`typing.Generic`. Note this includes `PEP 544`-compliant
      **protocols** (i.e., subclasses of the :class:`typing.Protocol` ABC),
      which implicitly subclass the :class:`typing.Generic` ABC as well.
    * If this hint is any other class declared by either the :mod:`typing`
      module (e.g., :class:`typing.TypeVar`) *or* the :mod:`beartype.cave`
      submodule (e.g., :class:`beartype.cave.HintPep585Type`), that class.
    * If this hint is a **forward reference** (i.e., string or instance of the
      concrete :class:`typing.ForwardRef` class), :class:`typing.ForwardRef`.
    * If this hint is a **type variable** (i.e., instance of the concrete
      :class:`typing.TypeVar` class), :class:`typing.TypeVar`.
    * Else, the unsubscripted :mod:`typing` attribute dynamically retrieved by
      inspecting this hint's **object representation** (i.e., the
      non-human-readable string returned by the :func:`repr` builtin).

    This getter function is memoized for efficiency.

    Motivation
    ----------
    Both `PEP 484`_ and the :mod:`typing` module implementing `PEP 484`_ are
    functionally deficient with respect to their public APIs. Neither provide
    external callers any means of deciding the categories of arbitrary
    PEP-compliant type hints. For example, there exists no general-purpose
    means of identifying a parametrized subtype (e.g., ``typing.List[int]``) as
    a parametrization of its unparameterized base type (e.g., ``type.List``).
    Thus this function, which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this
    oversight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    dict
        Sign uniquely identifying this hint.

    Raises
    ----------
    AttributeError
        If this object's representation is prefixed by the substring
        ``"typing."``, but the remainder of that representation up to but *not*
        including the first "[" character in that representation (e.g.,
        ``"Dict"`` for the object ``typing.Dict[str, Tuple[int, ...]]``) is
        *not* an attribute of the :mod:`typing` module.
    BeartypeDecorHintPepException
        If this object is *not* a PEP-compliant type hint.
    BeartypeDecorHintPepSignException
        If this object is a PEP-compliant type hint *not* uniquely identifiable

    * Objects defining this attribute to be their unsubscripted :mod:`typing`
      object (e.g., :attr:`typing.Optional`, :attr:`typing.Union`).
    * Objects defining this attribute to be their origin type.

    Since the :mod:`typing` module neither guarantees the existence of this

    this attribute is *not* safely directly accessible. Thus this function,
    which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this oversight.

    PEP-compliant objects).

    This getter is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the

    to an efficient one-liner.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function should always be called in lieu of attempting to directly
    access the low-level** ``__orig_bases__`` **dunder instance variable.**
    Most PEP-compliant type hints fail to declare that variable, guaranteeing
    :class:`AttributeError` exceptions from all general-purpose logic
    attempting to directly access that variable. Thus this function, which
    "fills in the gaps" by implementing this oversight.

    **This function returns tuples possibly containing a mixture of actual
    superclasses and pseudo-superclasses superficially masquerading as actual
    superclasses subscripted by one or more PEP-compliant child hints,**
    including type variables (e.g., ``(typing.Iterable[T], typing.Sized[T])``).
    In particular, most public attributes of the :mod:`typing` module used as
    superclasses are *not* actually types but singleton objects devilishly
    masquerading as types. Most actual :mod:`typing` superclasses are private,
    fragile, and prone to alteration or even removal between Python versions.

    Motivation
    ----------
    `PEP 560`_ (i.e., "Core support for typing module and generic types)
    formalizes the ``__orig_bases__`` dunder attribute first informally
    introduced by the :mod:`typing` module's implementation of `PEP 484`_.
    Naturally, `PEP 560`_ remains as unusable as `PEP 484`_ itself. Ideally,
    `PEP 560`_ would have generalized the core intention of preserving each
    original user-specified subclass tuple of superclasses as a full-blown
    ``__orig_mro__`` dunder attribute listing the original method resolution
    order (MRO) of that subclass had that tuple *not* been modified.

    Naturally, `PEP 560`_ did no such thing. The original MRO remains
    obfuscated and effectively inaccessible. While computing that MRO would
    technically be feasible, doing so would also be highly non-trivial,
    expensive, and fragile. Instead, this function retrieves *only* the tuple
    of :mod:`typing`-specific pseudo-superclasses that this object's class
    originally attempted (but failed) to subclass.

    You are probably now agitatedly cogitating to yourself in the darkness:
    "But @leycec: what do you mean `PEP 560`_? Wasn't `PEP 560`_ released
    *after* `PEP 484`_? Surely no public API defined by the Python stdlib would
    be so malicious as to silently alter the tuple of base classes listed by a
    user-defined subclass?"

    As we've established both above and elsewhere throughout the codebase,
    everything developed for `PEP 484` -- including `PEP 560`_, which derives
    its entire raison d'etre from `PEP 484`_ -- are fundamentally insane. In
    this case, `PEP 484`_ is insane by subjecting parametrized :mod:`typing`
    types employed as base classes to "type erasure," because:

         ...it is common practice in languages with generics (e.g. Java,
         TypeScript).

    Since Java and TypeScript are both terrible languages, blindly
    recapitulating bad mistakes baked into such languages is an equally bad
    mistake. In this case, "type erasure" means that the :mod:`typing` module
    *intentionally* destroys runtime type information for nebulous and largely
    unjustifiable reasons (i.e., Big Daddy Java and TypeScript do it, so it
    must be unquestionably good).

    Specifically, the :mod:`typing` module intentionally munges :mod:`typing`
    types listed as base classes in user-defined subclasses as follows:

    * All base classes whose origin is a builtin container (e.g.,
      ``typing.List[T]``) are reduced to that container (e.g.,
      :class:`list`).
    * All base classes derived from an abstract base class declared by the
      :mod:`collections.abc` subpackage (e.g., ``typing.Iterable[T]``) are
      reduced to that abstract base class (e.g.,
      ``collections.abc.Iterable``).
    * All surviving base classes that are parametrized (e.g.,
      ``typing.Generic[S, T]``) are stripped of that parametrization (e.g.,
      :class:`typing.Generic`).

    Since there exists no counterpart to the :class:`typing.Generic`
    superclass, the :mod:`typing` module preserves that superclass in
    unparametrized form. Naturally, this is useless, as an unparametrized
    :class:`typing.Generic` superclass conveys no meaningful type annotation.
    All other superclasses are reduced to their non-:mod:`typing`
    counterparts: e.g.,

        .. code-block:: python

        >>> from typing import TypeVar, Generic, Iterable, List
        >>> T = TypeVar('T')
        >>> class UserDefinedGeneric(List[T], Iterable[T], Generic[T]): pass
        # This is type erasure.
        >>> UserDefinedGeneric.__mro__
        (list, collections.abc.Iterable, Generic)
        # This is type preservation -- except the original MRO is discarded.
        # So, it's not preservation; it's reduction! We take what we can get.
        >>> UserDefinedGeneric.__orig_bases__
        (typing.List[T], typing.Iterable[T], typing.Generic[T])
        # Guess which we prefer?

    So, we prefer the generally useful ``__orig_bases__`` dunder tuple over
    the generally useless ``__mro__`` dunder tuple. Note, however, that the
    latter *is* still occasionally useful and thus occasionally returned by
    this getter. For inexplicable reasons, **single-inherited protocols**
    (i.e., classes directly subclassing *only* the `PEP 544`_-compliant
    :attr:`typing.Protocol` abstract base class (ABC)) are *not* subject to
    type erasure and thus constitute a notable exception to this heuristic:

        .. code-block:: python

        >>> from typing import Protocol
        >>> class UserDefinedProtocol(Protocol): pass
        >>> UserDefinedProtocol.__mro__
        (__main__.UserDefinedProtocol, typing.Protocol, typing.Generic, object)
        >>> UserDefinedProtocol.__orig_bases__
        AttributeError: type object 'UserDefinedProtocol' has no attribute '__orig_bases__'

    Welcome to :mod:`typing` hell, where even :mod:`typing` types lie broken
    and misshapen on the killing floor of overzealous theory-crafting purists.
