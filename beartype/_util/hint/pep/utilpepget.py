    Caveats
    ----------
    **This getter should always be called in lieu of attempting to directly
    access the low-level** ``__args__`` **dunder attribute.** Various
    singleton objects defined by the :mod:`typing` module (e.g.,
    :attr:`typing.Any`, :attr:`typing.NoReturn`) fail to define this attribute,
    guaranteeing :class:`AttributeError` exceptions from all general-purpose
    logic attempting to directly access this attribute. Thus this function,
    which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this oversight.

    **This getter never lies, unlike the comparable**
    :func:`get_hint_pep_typevars` **getter.** Whereas
    :func:`get_hint_pep_typevars` synthetically propagates type variables from
    child to parent type hints (rather than preserving the literal type
    variables subscripting this type hint), this getter preserves the literal
    arguments subscripting this type hint if any. Notable cases where the two
    differ include:

    * Generic classes subclassing pseudo-superclasses subscripted by one or
      more type variables (e.g., ``class MuhGeneric(Generic[S, T])``).
    * Unions subscripted by one or more child type hints subscripted by one or
      more type variables (e.g., ``Union[str, Iterable[Tuple[S, T]]]``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        PEP-compliant type hint to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    tuple
        Either:

        * If this hint defines an ``__args__`` dunder attribute, the value of

    **Sign** (i.e., :class:`HintSign` instance) uniquely identifying the passed
    PEP-compliant type hint if PEP-compliant *or* ``None`` otherwise (i.e., if
    this hint is *not* PEP-compliant).

    This getter function associates the passed hint with a public attribute of
    the :mod:`typing` module effectively acting as a superclass of this hint
    and thus uniquely identifying the "type" of this hint in the broadest sense
    of the term "type". These attributes are typically *not* actual types, as
    most actual :mod:`typing` types are private, fragile, and prone to extreme
    violation (or even removal) between major Python versions. Nonetheless,
    these attributes are sufficiently unique to enable callers to distinguish
    between numerous broad categories of :mod:`typing` behaviour and logic.

    Specifically, if this hint is:

    * A :pep:`585`-compliant **builtin** (e.g., C-based type
      hint instantiated by subscripting either a concrete builtin container
      class like :class:`list` or :class:`tuple` *or* an abstract base class
      (ABC) declared by the :mod:`collections.abc` submodule like
      :class:`collections.abc.Iterable` or :class:`collections.abc.Sequence`),
      this function returns ::class:`beartype.cave.HintGenericSubscriptedType`.
    * A **generic** (i.e., subclass of the :class:`typing.Generic` abstract
      base class (ABC)), this function returns :class:`HintSignGeneric`. Note
      this includes :pep:`544`-compliant **protocols** (i.e., subclasses of the
      :class:`typing.Protocol` ABC), which implicitly subclass the
      :class:`typing.Generic` ABC as well.
    * A **forward reference** (i.e., string or instance of the concrete
      :class:`typing.ForwardRef` class), this function returns
      :class:`HintSignTypeVar`.
    * A **type variable** (i.e., instance of the concrete
      :class:`typing.TypeVar` class), this function returns
      :class:`HintSignTypeVar`.
    * Any other class, this function returns that class as is.
    * Anything else, this function returns the unsubscripted :mod:`typing`
      attribute dynamically retrieved by inspecting this hint's **object
      representation** (i.e., the non-human-readable string returned by the
      :func:`repr` builtin).

    This getter is memoized for efficiency.

    Motivation
    ----------
    Both :pep:`484` and the :mod:`typing` module implementing :pep:`484` are
    functionally deficient with respect to their public APIs. Neither provide
    external callers any means of deciding the categories of arbitrary
    PEP-compliant type hints. For example, there exists no general-purpose
    means of identifying a parametrized subtype (e.g., ``typing.List[int]``) as
    a parametrization of its unparameterized base type (e.g., ``type.List``).
    Thus this function, which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this
    oversight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Type hint to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    dict
        Sign uniquely identifying this hint.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeDecorHintPepException
        If this hint is *not* PEP-compliant.

    #
    # Note that we intentionally avoid validating this type hint to be
    # PEP-compliant (e.g., by calling the die_unless_hint_pep() validator).
    # Why? Because this getter is the lowest-level hint validation function
    # underlying all higher-level hint validation functions! Calling the latter

    # ..................{ PHASE ~ classname                  }..................
    # This phase attempts to map from the fully-qualified classname of this
    # hint to a sign identifying *ALL* hints that are instances of that class.
    #
    # Since the "object.__class__.__qualname__" attribute is both guaranteed to
    # exist and be efficiently accessible for all hints, this phase is the
    # fastest and thus performed first. Although this phase identifies only a
    # small subset of hints, those hints are extremely common.
    #
    # More importantly, some of these classes are implemented as maliciously
    # masquerading as other classes entirely -- including __repr__() methods
    # synthesizing erroneous machine-readable representations. To avoid false
    # positives, this phase *MUST* thus be performed before repr()-based tests
    # regardless of efficiency concerns: e.g.,
    #     # Under Python >= 3.10:

    #     >>> repr(bad_guy_type_hint)
    #     typing.List   # <---- this is genuine bollocks
    #
    # Likewise, some of these classes define __repr__() methods prefixed by the
    # machine-readable representations of their children. Again, to avoid false
    # positives, this phase *MUST* thus be performed before repr()-based tests
    # regardless of efficiency concerns: e.g.,
    #     # Under Python >= 3.10:
    #     >>> repr(tuple[str, ...] | bool)

    #   dunder method returning a string prefixed by the "typing." substring.
    #   Ergo, we necessarily detect generics with an explicit test instead.
    # * *ALL* PEP 484-compliant generics and PEP 544-compliant protocols are
    #   guaranteed by the "typing" module to subclass this ABC regardless of
    #   whether those generics originally did so explicitly. How? By type

    # * *NO* PEP 585-compliant generics subclass this ABC unless those generics
    #   are also either PEP 484- or 544-compliant. Indeed, PEP 585-compliant
    #   generics subclass *NO* common superclass.
    # * Generics are *NOT* necessarily classes, despite originally being
    #   declared as classes. Although *MOST* generics are classes, some are
    #   shockingly *NOT*: e.g.,
    #       >>> from typing import Generic, TypeVar
    #       >>> S = TypeVar('S')

    #       False

    # Ergo, the "typing.Generic" ABC uniquely identifies many but *NOT* all

    # to subclass a common superclass leaves us with little alternative.

    '''
    **Unsafe origin object** (i.e., arbitrary object possibly related to the
    passed PEP-compliant type hint but *not* necessarily a non-:mod:`typing`
    class such that *all* objects satisfying this hint are instances of this
    class) originating this hint if this hint originates from an object *or*
    ``None`` otherwise (i.e., if this hint originates from *no* such object).

    This getter is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    :func:`callable_cached` decorator), as the implementation trivially reduces
    to an efficient one-liner.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **The high-level** :func:`get_hint_pep_origin_type_isinstanceable`
    function should always be called in lieu of this low-level function.**
    Whereas the former is guaranteed to return either a class or ``None``, this
    function enjoys no such guarantees and instead returns what the caller can
    only safely assume to be an arbitrary object.

    If this function *must* be called, **this function should always be called
    in lieu of attempting to directly access the low-level** ``__origin__``
    **dunder attribute.** That attribute is defined non-orthogonally by various
    singleton objects in the :mod:`typing` module, including:

    * Objects failing to define this attribute (e.g., :attr:`typing.Any`,
      :attr:`typing.NoReturn`).
    * Objects defining this attribute to be their unsubscripted :mod:`typing`
      object (e.g., :attr:`typing.Optional`, :attr:`typing.Union`).
    * Objects defining this attribute to be their origin type.

    Since the :mod:`typing` module neither guarantees the existence of this
    attribute nor imposes a uniform semantic on this attribute when defined,
    that attribute is *not* safely directly accessible. Thus this function,
    which "fills in the gaps" by implementing this oversight.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : object
        Object to be inspected.

    Returns
    ----------
    Optional[Any]
        Either:

        * If this hint originates from an arbitrary object, that object.
        * Else, ``None``.
