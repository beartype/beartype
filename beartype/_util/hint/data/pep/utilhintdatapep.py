'''
Frozen set of all **deeply supported signs** (i.e., arbitrary objects uniquely
identifying PEP-compliant type hints for which the :func:`beartype.beartype`
decorator generates deeply type-checking code).

This set contains *every* sign explicitly supported by one or more conditional
branches in the body of the
:func:`beartype._decor._code._pep._pephint.pep_code_check_hint` function
generating code deeply type-checking the current pith against the PEP-compliant
type hint annotated by a subscription of that attribute.

HINT_PEP_SIGNS_SUPPORTED_SHALLOW = set()
'''
Frozen set of all **shallowly supported non-originative signs** (i.e.,
arbitrary objects uniquely identifying PEP-compliant type hints *not*
originating from a non-:mod:`typing` origin type for which the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator generates shallow type-checking code).

# ....................{ SETS ~ type                       }....................

Frozen set of all **standard class signs** (i.e., instances of the builtin
:mod:`type` type uniquely identifying PEP-compliant type hints).

# Initialized by the _init() function below.
HINT_PEP_SIGNS_TYPE_ORIGIN = set()
'''
Frozen set of all **signs** (i.e., arbitrary objects) uniquely identifying
PEP-compliant type hints originating from an **origin type** (i.e.,
non-:mod:`typing` class such that *all* objects satisfying this hint are
instances of this class).

Since any arbitrary object is trivially type-checkable against an
:func:`isinstance`-able class by passing that object and class to the
:func:`isinstance` builtin, *all* parameters and return values annotated by
PEP-compliant type hints subscripting unsubscripted typing attributes listed in
this dictionary are shallowly type-checkable from wrapper functions generated
by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

# ....................{ SETS ~ subtype                    }....................
# Fully initialized by the _init() function below.
HINT_PEP_BASES_FORWARDREF = set()
'''
Tuple of all **PEP-compliant forward reference type hint superclasses** (i.e.,
superclasses such that all PEP-compliant type hints forward referencing
user-defined types are instances of these superclasses).
'''


# Initialized by the _init() function below.
HINT_PEP_SIGNS_SEQUENCE_STANDARD = set()
'''
Frozen set of all **standard sequence signs** (i.e., arbitrary objects uniquely
identifying PEP-compliant type hints accepting exactly one subscripted type
hint argument constraining *all* items of compliant sequences, which
necessarily satisfy the :class:`collections.abc.Sequence` protocol with
guaranteed ``O(1)`` indexation across all sequence items).

This set intentionally excludes the:

* :attr:`typing.AnyStr` sign, which accepts only the :class:`str` and
  :class:`bytes` types as its sole subscripted argument, which does *not*
  unconditionally constrain *all* items (i.e., unencoded and encoded characters
  respectively) of compliant sequences but instead parametrizes this attribute.
* :attr:`typing.ByteString` sign, which accepts *no* subscripted arguments.
  :attr:`typing.ByteString` is simply an alias for the
  :class:`collections.abc.ByteString` abstract base class (ABC) and thus
  already handled by our fallback logic for supported PEP-compliant type hints.
* :attr:`typing.Deque` sign, whose compliant objects (i.e.,
  :class:`collections.deque` instances) only `guarantee O(n) indexation across
  all sequence items <collections.deque_>`__:

     Indexed access is ``O(1)`` at both ends but slows to ``O(n)`` in the
     middle. For fast random access, use lists instead.

* :attr:`typing.NamedTuple` sign, which embeds a variadic number of
  PEP-compliant field type hints and thus requires special-cased handling.
* :attr:`typing.Text` sign, which accepts *no* subscripted arguments.
  :attr:`typing.Text` is simply an alias for the builtin :class:`str` type and
  thus handled elsewhere as a PEP-noncompliant type hint.
* :attr:`typing.Tuple` sign, which accepts a variadic number of subscripted
  arguments and thus requires special-cased handling.
