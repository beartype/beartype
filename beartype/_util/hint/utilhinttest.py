    Raise an exception unless the passed object is a **supported type hint**
    (i.e., object supported by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator as a
    valid type hint annotating callable parameters and return values).

    Specifically, this function raises an exception if this object is neither:

    * A **supported PEP-compliant type hint** (i.e., :mod:`beartype`-agnostic
      annotation compliant with annotation-centric PEPs currently supported
      by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator).
    * A **PEP-noncompliant type hint** (i.e., :mod:`beartype`-specific
      annotation intentionally *not* compliant with annotation-centric PEPs).

    Efficiency
    ----------
    This validator is effectively (but technically *not*) memoized. The passed
    ``exception_prefix`` parameter is usually unique to each call to this
    validator; memoizing this validator would uselessly consume excess space
    *without* improving time efficiency. Instead, this validator first calls the
    memoized :func:`.is_hint_pep` tester. If that tester returns :data:`True`,
    this validator immediately returns :data:`True` and is thus effectively
    memoized; else, this validator inefficiently raises a human-readable
    exception without memoization. Since efficiency is mostly irrelevant in
    exception handling, this validator remains effectively memoized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Object to be validated.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable substring prefixing raised exception messages. Defaults
        to the empty string.

    Raises
    ------
    BeartypeDecorHintPepUnsupportedException
        If this object is a PEP-compliant type hint currently unsupported by
        the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.
    BeartypeDecorHintNonpepException
        If this object is neither a:

        * Supported PEP-compliant type hint.
        * Supported PEP-noncompliant type hint.

#FIXME: Unit test us up, please.
def is_hint_cacheworthy(hint: Hint) -> bool:
    '''
    :data:`True` only if the passed type hint is **cache-worthy.**

    A hint is cache-worthy if *all* of the following constraints hold:

    * This hint is *not* already **self-cached** (i.e., internally memoized) by
      its owner class or module. Although most hints *used* to self-cache, most
      modern hints no longer self-cache. Why? No idea. It's probably an
      accidental oversight in PEP implementations across different CPython
      developers that nobody ever bothered to report: e.g.,

      .. code-block:: pycon

         # PEP 585 type hints do *NOT* self-cache and are thus cache-worthy.
         >>> list[int] is list[int]
         False  # <-- horrible! pep 585, you are horrible!

         # PEP 484 type hints do self-cache and are thus *NOT* cache-worthy.
         >>> import typing
         >>> typing.List[int] is typing.List[int]
         True  # <-- wonderful. pep 484, you are wonderful.

    * The **machine-readable representation** (i.e., string returned by passing
      this hint to the :func:`repr` builtin) of this hint is **unambiguous**
      (i.e., there exists a one-to-one mapping between this representation and
      the contents of this representation such that only equal hints have equal
      representations). Although most hints have unambiguous representations,
      some hints have ambiguous representations -- including:

      * Type hints transitively parametrized by one or more **type variables**
        (i.e., :obj:`typing.TypeVar` objects) have ambiguous representations and
        are thus *not* cache-worthy. Note that the existence of even a single
        type variable parametrizing a single child type hint subscripting a
        parent type hint sadly renders the *entire* representation of that
        parent type hint ambiguous: e.g.,

        .. code-block:: pycon

           >>> from typing import TypeVar
           >>> T_int = TypeVar('T', bound=int)
           >>> T_str = TypeVar('T', bound=str)
           >>> repr(list[T_int])
           list[T]  # <-- ...ok
           >>> repr(list[T_str])
           list[T]  # <-- WUT U SAY!?
           >>> repr(list[T_int]) == repr(list[T_str])
           True  # <-- horrible! "TypeVar", you are horrible!

    Caveats
    -------
    This function *cannot* be meaningfully memoized, since the passed type hint
    is *not* guaranteed to be cached somewhere. Only functions passed cached
    type hints can be meaningfully memoized. Since this high-level function
    internally defers to unmemoized low-level functions that are ``O(n)`` for
    ``n`` the size of the inheritance hierarchy of this hint, this function
    should be called sparingly.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be inspected.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        :data:`True` only if this type hint is uncached.

def is_hint_needs_cls_stack(hint: Hint) -> bool:
    '''
    :data:`True` only if the passed type hint is **type stack-dependent** (i.e.,
    if :mod:`beartype` requires the tuple of all classes lexically declaring the
    class variables or methods annotated by this hint to generate code
    type-checking this hint).

    This tester returns :data:`False` for most hints; only a small subset of
    hints are type stack-dependent. This includes:

    * :pep:`673`-compliant self type hint (i.e., :obj:`typing.Self`), which is
      contextually valid *only* inside a lexical class declaration.

    This tester is memoized for efficiency.

    Motivation
    ----------
    **This tester should only be called to decide whether memoized callables
    should be passed a type stack.** Passing memoized callables a type stack
    substantially reduces the likelihood of a cache hit and thus the
    average-case efficiency of calls to those callables. Notably:

    * Most type hints do *not* require a type stack.
    * Most type hints annotate class variables and methods of differing classes
      and thus do *not* share the same type stack.

    Ergo, passing memoized callables both a type hint *and* a type stack
    effectively unmemoizes those callables. Thankfully, callers can elide this
    inefficiency by calling this tester first; when this tester returns:

    * :data:`False`, the caller can safely pass memoized callables a type hint
      and :data:`None` for the type stack, thus preserving memoization. This is
      the common case and thus absolutely worth optimizing for.
    * :data:`True`, the caller has *no* choice but to pass memoized callables
      both a type hint *and* a type stack. Grr!

    Parameters
    ----------
    hint : Hint
        Type hint to be inspected.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        :data:`True` only if this type hint is type stack-dependent.

    # Return true only if this representation embeds the representation of:

    #
    # Note:
    # * The fully-qualified names of exact typing modules (e.g., "typing",
    #   "typing_extensions") is intentionally ignored. Although we could
    #   certainly explicitly test for both, doing so would only needlessly
    #   reduce efficiency. By omitting explicit tests for both, this tester
    #   intentionally returns false positives for extremely edge case hints
    #   whose representations contain syntactically related but semantically
    #   unrelated substrings (e.g., "typing.Literal['.Self']", which is clearly
    #   *NOT* a PEP 673-compliant self type hint but erroneously matched as one
    #   by this heuristic). This is non-ideal but thankfully ignorable. See the
    #   "Motivation" section of the docstring for further commentary.
    # * This string is intentionally *NOT* preceded by a "." delimiter (e.g., as
    #   ".Self" rather than "Self"). Previously, this string was intentionally
    #   preceded by a "." delimiter; doing so satisfied most edge cases while
    #   reducing the likelihood of a false positive. Sadly, doing so also failed
    #   to match "Self" type hints stringified by PEP 563. Grrr!
    # * That the "in" operator is known to be the fastest means of performing
    #   substring matching in Python. Indeed:
    #   * "in" is faster than the str.find() method, which is *SUBSTANTIALLY*
    #     faster than the re.match() function, which is an entire of magnitude
    #     slower than "in".
    #   * re.match() only begins to catch up to "in" when concurrently testing
    #     for more than 10 or so substrings (e.g., r'(0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9)').
