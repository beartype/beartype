    environment variable is currently set to a non-zero integer).

    This tester is intentionally *not* memoized (e.g., by the
    ``@callable_cached`` decorator), as doing so would prevent this tester from
    detecting dynamic changes to the ``PYTHONOPTIMIZE`` environment variable
    manually applied by the external user. Technically, Python itself detects
    *no* such changes. Pragmatically, there's *no* demonstrable justification
    for :mod:`beartype` itself to behave similarly; since testing environment
    variable values is both trivial *and* yields a better outcome for users,
    this tester does so. Indeed, our userbase `explicitly requested that we do
    so <beartype issue_>`__.

def get_interpreter_command_words() -> CommandWords:
    '''
    **Active Python interpreter command words** (i.e., iterable of one or more
    shell words unambiguously running the executable binary for this interpreter
    and machine architecture).

    This getter is memoized for efficiency.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This high-level getter should always be called in lieu of the low-level**
    :func:`.get_interpreter_filename` **getter** when attempting to rerun this
    interpreter as a subprocess of the active Python process. Why? Because the
    absolute filename of the executable binary for this interpreter is
    insufficient to unambiguously run this binary under edge cases, including:

    * **macOS.** Under macOS, the executable binary for this interpreter may be
      bundled with one or more other executable binaries targeting different
      machine architectures (e.g., 32-bit, 64-bit) in a single so-called
      "universal binary." Distinguishing between these bundled binaries requires
      passing this interpreter to a prefixing macOS-specific command: ``arch``.

    Returns
    -------
    CommandWords
        Iterable of one or more shell words unambiguously running this binary.
    '''

    #FIXME: Uncomment if required. Although this was certainly required a decade
    #ago, it's unclear whether this is still required; indeed, given the
