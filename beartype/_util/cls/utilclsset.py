    Dynamically set the **class variable** (i.e., attribute of the passed class)
    with the passed name to the passed value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cls : type
        Class to set this attribute on.
    attr_name : str
        Name of the class attribute to be set.
    attr_value : object
        Value to set this class attribute to.
    setattr_func : Callable[[object, str, object], None], default: setattr
        :func:`setattr`-like callable to be called to set this attribute on this
        class. Defaults to the C-based :func:`setattr` builtin, which internally
        defers to the ``__setattr__()`` dunder method guaranteed to be defined
        by all classes (due to the existence of the :class:`type.__setattr__`
        dunder method). Though this default suffices for most use cases, a small
        subset of outlier edge cases require that this setter call a non-default
        :func:`setattr`-like callable.

        :pep:`557-compliant frozen dataclasses are the canonical example. They
        guarantee immutability by overriding the ``__setattr__()`` dunder method
        (implicitly called by the :func:`setattr` builtin) to unconditionally
        raise an exception. While understandable, this behaviour prevents the
        :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator from monkey-patching type-checking
        into frozen dataclasses by replacing their default ``__setattr__()``
        with a :func:`beartype.beartype`-specific alternative performing
        type-checking; attempting to do so ironically invokes that same
        ``__setattr__()`, which then raises an exception. This behaviour can be
        circumvented by passing the :func:`type.__setattr__` dunder method as
        this parameter, which then applies the desired monkey-patch *without*
        raising an exception. In short, stupid kludges is always the answer.

    Caveats
    -------
    **This function is unavoidably slow.** Class attributes are *only* settable
    by calling the tragically slow :func:`setattr` builtin. Attempting to
    directly set an attribute on the class dictionary raises an exception: e.g.,

    .. code-block:: pycon

       >>> class OhGodHelpUs(object): pass
       >>> OhGodHelpUs.__dict__['even_god_cannot_help'] = 2
       TypeError: 'mappingproxy' object does not support item assignment

    Why? Because class dictionaries are actually low-level :class:`mappingproxy`
    objects that intentionally override the ``__setattr__()`` dunder method to
    unconditionally raise an exception. Why? Because that constraint enables the
    :meth:`type.__setattr__` dunder method to enforce critical efficiency
    constraints on class attributes -- including that class attribute keys are
    *not* only strings but also valid Python identifiers:
