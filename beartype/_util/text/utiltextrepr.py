**Beartype string munging utilities** (i.e., callables transforming passed
strings into new strings with generic string operations).

This private submodule implements supplementary string-handling utility
functions required by various :mod:`beartype` facilities, including callables
generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def get_object_representation(obj: object, max_len: int = 76) -> str:
    '''
    Pretty-printed quasi-human-readable variant of the string returned by the
    non-pretty-printed machine-readable :meth:`obj.__repr__` dunder method of
    the passed object, truncated to the passed maximum string length.

    Specifically, this function (in order):

    #. Obtains this object's representation by calling ``repr(object)``.
    #. If this representation is *not* prefixed by a punctuation character
       (i.e., character in the standard :attr:`string.punctuation` set),
       double-quotes this representation for disambiguity with preceding
       characters -- notably, sequence indices. Since the string returned by
       this function commonly follows sequence indices in exception messages,
       failing to disambiguate the two produces non-human-readable output:

           >>> def wat(mate: typing.List[str]) -> int: return len(mate)
           >>> raise_pep_call_exception(
           ...     func=muh_func, pith_name='mate', pith_value=[7,])
           beartype.roar.BeartypeCallCheckPepParamException: @beartyped wat()
           parameter mate=[7] violates PEP type hint typing.List[str], as list
           item 0 value 7 not a str.

       Note the substring "item 0 value 7", which misreads like a blatant bug.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This function is unavoidably slow and should thus not be called from
    optimized performance-critical code.** This function internally performs
    mildly expensive operations, including regular expression-based matching
    and substitution. Ideally, this function should *only* be called to create
    user-oriented exception messages where performance is a negligible concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to be represented.
    max_len: Optional[int]
        Maximum length of the string to be returned. Defaults to the customary
        line length of 80 characters minus default output indentation of four
        characters.

    Returns
    ----------
    str
        Pretty-printed quasi-human-readable variant of this object's
        non-pretty-printed machine-readable representation.

    # (albeit less human-readable) output of repr() is preferred to the terse
    # (albeit more human-readable) output of str().

    # Note that this representation is guaranteed to be non-empty, as *ALL*
    # objects (including outlier singletons like "None" and the empty string)
