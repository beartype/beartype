    # Return true only if the fully-qualified name of this callable contains
    # one or more "." delimiters, each signifying a nested lexical scope. Since
    # *ALL* callables (i.e., both pure-Python and C-based) define a non-empty
    # "__qualname__" dunder variable containing at least their unqualified
    # names, this simplistic test is guaranteed to be safe.
    #
    # Note this function intentionally tests for the general-purpose existence
    # of a "." delimiter rather than the special-cased existence of a
    # ".<locals>." placeholder substring. Why? Because there are two types of
    # nested callables:
    # * Non-methods, which are lexically nested in a parent callable whose
    #   scope encapsulates all previously declared local variables. For unknown
    #   reasons, the unqualified names of nested non-method callables are

    # * Methods, which are lexically nested in the scope encapsulating all
    #   previously declared class variables (i.e., variables declared in class
    #   scope and thus accessible as method annotations). For unknown reasons,
    #   the unqualified names of methods are *NEVER* prefixed by ".<locals>."
    #   in their "__qualname__" variables: e.g.,
    #       >>> from typing import ClassVar
    #       >>> class MuhClass(object):

    **Local scope** for the passed callable.

    This getter returns either:

    * If that callable is **nested** (i.e., is a method *or* is a non-method
      callable declared in the body of another callable), a dictionary mapping
      from the name to value of each **locally scoped attribute** (i.e., local
      attribute declared by a parent callable transitively declaring that
      callable) accessible to that callable.
    * Else, the empty dictionary otherwise (i.e., if that callable is a
      function directly declared by a module).

    This getter transparently supports methods, which in Python are lexically
    nested in the scope encapsulating all previously declared **class
    variables** (i.e., variables declared from class scope and thus accessible
    as type hints when annotating the methods of that class). When declaring a
    class, Python creates a stack frame for the declaration of that class whose
    local scope is the set of all class-scoped attributes declared in the body
    of that class (including class variables, class methods, static methods,
    and instance methods). When passed any method, this getter finds and
    returns that local scope. When passed the ``MuhClass.muh_method` method
    declared by the following example, for example, this getter returns the
    local scope containing the key ``'muh_class_var'`` with value ``int``:

    .. code-block:: python

       >>> from typing import ClassVar
       >>> class MuhClass(object):
       ...    # Class variable declared in class scope.
       ...    muh_class_var: ClassVar[type] = int
       ...    # Instance method annotated by this class variable.
       ...    def muh_method(self) -> muh_class_var: return 42

    Caveats
    ----------
    **This high-level getter requires the private low-level**
    :func:`sys._getframe` **getter.** If that getter is undefined, this getter
    unconditionally treats the passed callable as module-scoped by returning the
    empty dictionary rather than raising an exception. Since all standard
    Python implementations (e.g., CPython, PyPy) define that getter, this
    should typically *not* be a real-world concern.

    **This high-level getter is inefficient and should thus only be called if
    absolutely necessary.** Specifically, deciding the local scope for any
    callable is an ``O(k)`` operation for ``k`` the distance in call stack
    frames from the call of the current function to the call of the top-most
    parent scope transitively declaring the passed callable in its submodule.
    Ergo, this decision problem should be deferred as long as feasible to
    minimize space and time consumption.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : Callable
        Callable to be inspected.
    func_stack_frames_ignore : int, optional
        Number of frames on the call stack to be ignored (i.e., silently
        incremented past), such that the next non-ignored frame following the
        last ignored frame is the parent callable or module directly declaring
        the passed callable. Defaults to 0.

    Add a new **scoped attribute** (i.e., new key-value pair of the passed
    dictionary mapping from the name to value of each globally or locally scoped
    attribute externally accessed elsewhere, whose key is a machine-readable
    name internally generated by this function to uniquely refer to the passed
    object and whose value is that object) to the passed scope *and* return that
    name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    attr : Any
        Arbitrary object to be added to this scope.
    func_scope : CallableScope
        Local or global scope to add this object to.
    exception_prefix : str, optional
        Human-readable label prefixing the representation of this object in the
        exception message. Defaults to the empty string.

    Returns
    ----------
    str
        Name of the passed object in this scope generated by this function.

    Raises
    ----------
    :exc:`_BeartypeUtilCallableException`
        If an attribute with the same name as that internally generated by
        this adder but having a different value already exists in this scope.
        This adder uniquifies names by object identifier and should thus
        *never* generate name collisions. This exception is thus intentionally
        raised as a private rather than public exception.
