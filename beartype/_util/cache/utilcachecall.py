**Beartype callable caching utilities.**

This private submodule implements supplementary cache-specific utility
functions required by various :mod:`beartype` facilities, including callables
generated by the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator.

    **Memoize** (i.e., efficiently cache and return all previously returned
    values of the passed callable as well as all previously raised exceptions
    of that callable previously rather than inefficiently recalling that
    callable) the passed callable.

    Specifically, this decorator (in order):

    #. Creates:

       * A local dictionary mapping parameters passed to this callable with the
         values returned by this callable when passed those parameters.
       * A local dictionary mapping parameters passed to this callable with the
         exceptions raised by this callable when passed those parameters.

    #. Creates and returns a closure transparently wrapping this callable with
       memoization. Specifically, this wrapper (in order):

       #. Tests whether this callable has already been called at least once
          with the passed parameters by lookup of those parameters in these
          dictionaries.
       #. If this callable previously raised an exception when passed these
          parameters, this wrapper re-raises the same exception.
       #. Else if this callable returned a value when passed these parameters,
          this wrapper re-returns the same value.
       #. Else, this wrapper:

          #. Calls that callable with those parameters.
          #. If that call raised an exception:

             #. Caches that exception with those parameters in that dictionary.
             #. Raises that exception.

          #. Else:

             #. Caches the value returned by that call with those parameters in
                that dictionary.
             #. Returns that value.

    Caveats
    ----------
    **No parameters accepted by the decorated callable may be variadic** (i.e.,
    either variadic positional or keyword arguments). While memoizing variadic
    parameters would of course be feasible, this decorator has yet to implement
    support for memoizing variadic parameters.

    **Order of keyword arguments passed to the decorated callable is
    significant.** This decorator recaches return values produced by calls to
    the decorated callable when passed the same keyword arguments in differing
    order (e.g., ``muh_func(muh_kw=0, mah_kw=1)`` and ``muh_func(mah_kw=1,
    muh_kw=0)``, cached as two distinct calls by this decorator despite these
    calls ultimately receiving the same arguments).

    Efficiency
    ----------
    For efficiency, consider calling the decorated callable with only:

    * **Positional arguments.** While technically supported, every call to the
      decorated callable passed one or more keyword arguments reduces both the
      space and time efficiency of the memoization performed by that callable.
    * **Hashable** (i.e., immutable) arguments. While technically supported,
      every call to the decorated callable passed one or more unhashable
      arguments (e.g., mutable containers like lists and dictionaries) will
      *not* be memoized. Equivalently, only calls passed only hashable
      arguments will be memoized. This flexibility enables decorated callables
      to accept unhashable PEP-compliant type hints. Although *all*
      PEP-noncompliant and *most* PEP-compliant type hints are hashable, some
      sadly are not. These include:

      * `PEP 585`_-compliant type hints subscripted by one or more unhashable
        objects (e.g., ``collections.abc.Callable[[], str]``, the `PEP
        585`_-compliant type hint annotating piths accepting callables
        accepting no parameters and returning strings).
      * `PEP 586`_-compliant type hints subscripted by an unhashable object
        (e.g., ``typing.Literal[[]]``, a literal empty list).
      * `PEP 593`_-compliant type hints subscripted by one or more unhashable
        objects (e.g., ``typing.Annotated[typing.Any, []]``, the
        :attr:`typing.Any` singleton annotated by an empty list).

    **This decorator is intentionally not implemented in terms of the stdlib**
    :func:`functools.lru_cache` **decorator,** as that decorator is inefficient
    in the special case of unbounded caching with ``maxsize=None``, mostly as
    that decorator insists on unconditionally recording irrelevant statistics
    such as cache misses and hits. While bounding the number of cached values
    is advisable in the general case (e.g., to avoid exhausting memory merely
    for optional caching), the callable parameters and return values cached by
    this package are sufficiently small in size to render bounding irrelevant.

    Consider the
    :func:`beartype._util.hint.pep.utilhintpeptest.is_hint_pep_class_typing`
    function, for example. Each call to that function only accepts a single
    class and returns a boolean. Under conservative assumptions of 4 bytes of
    storage per class reference and 4 byte of storage per boolean reference,
    each call to that function requires caching at most 8 bytes of storage.
    Again, under conservative assumptions of at most 1024 unique type
    annotations for the average downstream consumer, memoizing that function in
    full requires at most 1024 * 8 == 8096 bytes or ~8Kb of storage. Clearly,
    8Kb of overhead is sufficiently negligible to obviate any space concerns
    that would warrant an LRU cache in the first place.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : CallableTypes
        Callable to be memoized.

    Returns
    ----------
    CallableTypes
        Closure wrapping this callable with memoization.

    Raises
    ----------
    _BeartypeUtilCallableCachedException
        If any parameter passed to this callable is **variadic**, including:

        * A variadic positional argument resembling ``*args``.
        * A variadic keyword argument resembling ``**kwargs``.

        Warns
        ----------
        _BeartypeUtilCallableCachedKwargsWarning
            If one or more keyword arguments were passed. While technically
            supported, keyword arguments are substantially more space- and
            time-intensive to memoize than equivalent positional arguments,
            partially defeating the purpose of memoization in the first place.
