    **Builtin collection type hint** (i.e., subscripted C-based type whose

    passed object (including *all* items transitively reachable from this
    object) if this object is an instance of a builtin collection type *or*
    :data:`None` otherwise (i.e., if this object is *not* an instance of a
    builtin collection type).

    This function *cannot* be memoized, due to necessarily accepting the
    ``__beartype_obj_ids_seen__`` parameter unique to each call to the parent
    :func:`beartype.door.infer_hint` function. Moreover, this function exhibits
    worst-case constant time complexity :math:`O(1)`; memoization is irrelevant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : object
        Object to infer a type hint from.

    All remaining keyword parameters are passed as is to the lower-level
    :func:`beartype.door._func.infer.collection.infercollectionitems.infer_hint_collection_items`
    function.

    Returns
    -------
    Optional[object]
        Either:

        * If this object is a builtin collection type, this type subscripted by
          the union of the child type hints validating *all* items of this
          collection (e.g., ``list[str]``).
        * Else, :data:`None`.

    '''
    **Builtin collection superclass** (i.e., unsubscripted C-based type whose
    instances contain one or more reiterable items) of the passed class if this
    class subclasses a builtin collection type *or* :data:`None` otherwise
    (i.e., if this class does *not* subclass a builtin collection type).

    This function does *not* return a type hint annotating the passed class.
    This function merely returns a subscriptable type hint factory suitable for
    the caller to subscript with a child type hint, which then produces the
    desired type hint annotating the passed class. Why this indirection? In a
    word: efficiency. If this function recursively inferred and returned a full
    type hint, this function would need to guard against infinite recursion by
    accepting the ``__beartype_obj_ids_seen__`` parameter also accepted by the
    parent :func:`beartype.door._func.infer.inferhint.infer_hint` function;
    doing so would prevent memoization, substantially reducing efficiency.

    This function is memoized for efficiency.
