    Type hint recursively validating the passed collection (including *all*
    items transitively reachable from this collection), defined by subscripting
    the passed type hint factory by the union of the child type hints validating
    these items.

    This function *cannot* be memoized, due to necessarily accepting the
    ``__beartype_obj_ids_seen__`` parameter unique to each call to the parent
    :func:`beartype.door.infer_hint` function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    obj : CollectionABC
        Collection to infer a type hint from.
    hint_factory : object
        Subscriptable type hint factory validating this collection (e.g., the
        :pep:`585`-compliant :class:`list` builtin type if this collection is a
        list).
    conf : BeartypeConf, optional
        **Beartype configuration** (i.e., self-caching dataclass encapsulating
        all settings configuring type-checking for the passed object).
    __beartype_obj_ids_seen__ : FrozenSet[int]
        **Recursion guard.** See also the parameter of the same name accepted by
        the :func:`beartype.door._func.infer.inferhint.infer_hint` function.
    origin_type : Optional[type]
        Either:

        * If the caller requires support for so-called "virtual subclasses" in
          which the passed ``obj`` collection is an instance of a user-defined
          class that does *not* explicitly subclass a :mod:`collections.abc`
          abstract base class (ABC) but does nonetheless implicitly satisfy the
          protocol implied by such an ABC, the ABC implicitly satisfied by this
          collection. Ideally, all :mod:`collections.abc` collections would
          support virtual subclassing by defining the ``__subclasshook__()`
          dunder method. Indeed, most do -- but some (e.g.,
          :class:`collections.abc.Mapping`) do *not*. This parameter enables
          callers to overcome this probably unintentional oversight in CPython.
        * Else, :data:`None`. In this case, this parameter actually defaults to
          the type of the passed ``obj`` collection.

        Defaults to :data:`None`.

_ROOT_TUPLE_FIXED_ITEMS_LEN_MAX = 10
'''
Maximum inclusive number of tuple items below which the private
:func:`._infer_hint_reiterable_items` function infers a **root tuple** (i.e.,
top-most object originally passed by the caller to the public
:func:`beartype.door.infer_hint` function) to be validated by a **fixed-length
tuple type hint** of the form ``tuple[{hint_child1}, ???, {hint_childN}]``.

Specifically, for each root tuple containing:

* Less than or equal to this number of items, this tuple is annotated by a
  **fixed-length tuple type hint** of the form ``tuple[{hint_child1}, ???,
  {hint_childN}]``.
* Greater than this number of items, this tuple is annotated by a **variadic
  tuple type hint** of the form ``tuple[{hint_childs}, ...]``.

This magic number enables an ad-hoc heuristic for disambiguating between
fixed-length and variadic tuple type hints. Technically, *any* tuple may be
ambiguously annotated as either. Pragmatically, fixed-length tuple type hints
exist almost exclusively to annotate **multiple-return functions** (i.e.,
functions returning two or more values as a tuple whose items are those values);
variadic tuple type hints annotate all other tuples, which is most of them.
Since all multiple-return functions return a root tuple *and* since most
real-world multiple-return functions of interest return a root tuple containing
less than or equal to this magic number of items, this heuristic follows.
