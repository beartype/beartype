**Beartype cave.**

This submodule collects common types (e.g., :class:`NoneType`, the type of the
``None`` singleton) and tuples of common types (e.g., :data:`CallableTypes`, a
tuple of the types of all callable objects).

PEP 484
----------
This module is intentionally *not* compliant with the `PEP 484`_ standard
implemented by the stdlib :mod:`typing` module, which formalizes type hinting
annotations with a catalogue of generic classes and metaclasses applicable to
common use cases. :mod:`typing` enables end users to enforce contractual
guarantees over the contents of arbitrarily complex data structures with the
assistance of third-party static type checkers (e.g., :mod:`mypy`,
:mod:`pyre`), runtime type checkers (e.g., :mod:`beartype`, :mod:`typeguard`),
and integrated development environments (e.g., PyCharm).

Genericity comes at a cost, though. Deeply type checking a container containing
``n`` items, for example, requires type checking both that container itself
non-recursively *and* each item in that container recursively. Doing so has
time complexity ``O(N)`` for ``N >= n`` the total number of items transitively
contained in this container (i.e., items directly contained in this container
*and* items directly contained in containers contained in this container).
While the cost of this operation can be paid either statically *or* amortized
at runtime over all calls to annotated callables accepting that container, the
underlying cost itself remains the same.

By compare, this module only contains standard Python classes and tuples of
such classes intended to be passed as is to the C-based :func:`isinstance`
builtin and APIs expressed in terms of that builtin (e.g., :mod:`beartype`).
This module only enables end users to enforce contractual guarantees over the
types but *not* contents of arbitrarily complex data structures. This
intentional tradeoff maximizes runtime performance at a cost of ignoring the
types of items contained in containers.

NoneType = type(None)
'''
Type of the ``None`` singleton.

Curiously, although the type of the ``None`` object is a class object whose
``__name__`` attribute is ``NoneType``, there exists no globally accessible
class by that name. To circumvents this obvious oversight, this global globally
exposes this class.

This class is principally useful for annotating both:

* Callable parameters accepting ``None`` as a valid value.
* Callables returning ``None`` as a valid value.

Note that, for obscure and uninteresting reasons, the standard :mod:`types`
module defined the same type with the same name under Python 2.x but *not* 3.x.
Depressingly, this type must now be manually redefined everywhere.
'''

'''
Type of all types.

Abstract base class of all **file-like objects** (i.e., objects implementing
the standard ``read()``, ``write()``, and ``close()`` methods).

'''
Type of all **pure-Python partial callables** (i.e., callables dynamically
wrapped by the function-like :class:`functools.partial` class, implemented in
pure Python).

Caveats
----------
This type does *not* distinguish between whether the original callable wrapped
by :class:`functools.partial` is C-based or pure Python -- only that some
callable of indeterminate origin is in fact wrapped.

FunctionType = _FunctionType
'''
Type of all **pure-Python functions** (i.e., functions implemented in Python

Caveats
----------
**This type ambiguously matches many callables not commonly associated with
standard functions,** including:

* **Lambda functions.** Of course, distinguishing between conventional named
  functions and unnamed lambda functions would usually be seen as overly
  specific. So, this ambiguity is *not* necessarily a bad thing.
* **Unbound instance methods** (i.e., instance methods accessed on their
  declaring classes rather than bound instances).
* **Static methods** (i.e., methods decorated with the builtin
  :func:`staticmethod` decorator regardless of whether accessed on their
  declaring classes or associated instances).

**This type matches no callables whatsoever under some non-CPython
interpreters,** including:

* PyPy, which unconditionally compiles *all* pure-Python functions into C-based
  functions. Ergo, under PyPy, *all* functions are guaranteed to be of the type
  :class:`FunctionOrMethodCType` regardless of whether those functions were
  initially defined in Python or C.

implicitly passed those instances or classes as their first parameters).

Caveats
----------
There exists *no* corresponding :class:`MethodUnboundInstanceType` type, as
unbound pure-Python instance methods are ambiguously implemented as functions
of type :class:`FunctionType` indistinguishable from conventional functions.
Indeed, `official documentation <PyInstanceMethod_Type documentation_>`__ for
the ``PyInstanceMethod_Type`` C type explicitly admits that:

'''
Type of all **containers** (i.e., concrete instances of the abstract
:class:`collections.abc.Container` base class as well as arbitrary objects
whose classes implement all abstract methods declared by that base class
regardless of whether those classes actually subclass that base class).

Caveats
----------
This type ambiguously matches both:

* **Explicit container subtypes** (i.e., concrete subclasses of the
  :class:`collections.abc.Container` abstract base class (ABC)).
* **Structural container subtypes** (i.e., arbitrary classes implementing the
  abstract ``__contains__`` method declared by that ABC *without* subclassing
  that ABC), as formalized by `PEP 544 -- Protocols: Structural subtyping
  (static duck typing) <PEP 544_>`_. Notably, since the **NumPy array type**
  (i.e., :class:`numpy.ndarray`) defines that method, this type magically
  matches the NumPy array type as well.

Of course, distinguishing between explicit and structural subtypes would
usually be seen as overly specific. So, this ambiguity is *not* necessarily a
BadThing™.

What is a BadThing™ is that container ABCs violate the "explicit is better than
implicit" maxim of `PEP 20 -- The Zen of Python <PEP 20_>`__ by intentionally
deceiving you for your own benefit, which you of course appreciate. Thanks to
arcane dunder magics buried in the :class:`abc.ABCMeta` metaclass, the
:func:`isinstance` and :func:`issubclass` builtin functions (which the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator internally defers to) ambiguously mistype
structural container subtypes as explicit container subtypes:

   >>> from collections.abc import Container
   >>> class FakeContainer(object):
   ...     def __contains__(self, obj): return True
   >>> FakeContainer.__mro__

IterableType = _Iterable
'''
Type of all **iterables** (i.e., both concrete and structural instances of the
abstract :class:`collections.abc.Iterable` base class).

Iterables are containers that may be indirectly iterated over by calling the
:func:`iter` builtin, which internally calls the ``__iter__()`` dunder methods
implemented by these containers, which return **iterators** (i.e., instances of
the :class:`IteratorType` type), which directly support iteration.

This type also matches **NumPy arrays** (i.e., instances of the concrete
:class:`numpy.ndarray` class) via structural subtyping.

'''


IteratorType = _Iterator
'''
Type of all **iterators** (i.e., both concrete and structural instances of
the abstract :class:`collections.abc.Iterator` base class; objects iterating
over associated data streams, which are typically containers).

Iterators implement at least two dunder methods:

* ``__next__()``, iteratively returning successive items from associated data
  streams (e.g., container objects) until throwing standard
  :data:`StopIteration` exceptions on reaching the ends of those streams.
* ``__iter__()``, returning themselves. Since iterables (i.e., instances of the
  :class:`IterableType` type) are *only* required to implement the
  ``__iter__()`` dunder method, all iterators are by definition iterables as
  well.

containers defining the ``__contains__()``, ``__iter__()``, and ``__len__()``
dunder methods) if the active Python interpreter is at least version 3.6.0 *or*
:class:`UnavailableType` otherwise.

This type also matches **NumPy arrays** (i.e., instances of the concrete
:class:`numpy.ndarray` class) via structural subtyping.

'''


QueueType = _deque
'''
Type of all **double-ended queues** (i.e., instances of the concrete
:class:`collections.deque` class, the only queue type defined by the Python
stdlib).

Caveats
----------
The :mod:`collections.abc` subpackage currently provides no corresponding
abstract interface to formalize queue types. Double-ended queues are it, sadly.
'''


SetType = _Set
'''
Type of all **set-like containers** (i.e., both concrete and structural
instances of the abstract :class:`collections.abc.Set` base class; containers
guaranteeing uniqueness across all contained items).

This type matches both the standard :class:`set` and :class:`frozenset` types
*and* the types of the :class:`dict`-specific views returned by the
:meth:`dict.items` and :meth:`dict.keys` (but *not* :meth:`dict.values`)
methods.

'''
Type of all **mutable** and **immutable mappings** (i.e., both concrete and
structural instances of the abstract :class:`collections.abc.Mapping` base
class; dictionary-like containers containing key-value pairs mapping from
hashable keys to corresponding values).

Caveats
----------
**This type does not guarantee mutability** (i.e., the capacity to modify
instances of this type after instantiation). This type ambiguously matches both
mutable mapping types (e.g., :class:`dict`) and immutable mapping types (e.g.,
:class:`mappingproxy`). Where mutability is required, prefer the non-ambiguous
:class:`MappingMutableType` type instead.

'''
Type of all **mutable** and **immutable sequences** (i.e., both concrete and
structural instances of the abstract :class:`collections.abc.Sequence` base
class; reversible collections whose items are efficiently accessible but *not*
necessarily modifiable with 0-based integer-indexed lookup).

Caveats
----------
**This type does not guarantee mutability** (i.e., the capacity to modify
instances of this type after instantiation). This type ambiguously matches both
mutable sequence types (e.g., :class:`list`) and immutable sequence types
(e.g., :class:`tuple`). Where mutability is required, prefer the non-ambiguous
:class:`SequenceMutableType` type instead.

**This type matches the string type (i.e., :class:`str`),** which satisfies the
:class:`collections.abc.Sequence` API but *not* the
:class:`collections.abc.MutableSequence` API. Where **non-string sequences**
(i.e., sequences that are anything but strings) are required, prefer the
non-ambiguous :class:`SequenceMutableType` type instead.

**This type does not match NumPy arrays (i.e., instances of the concrete
:class:`numpy.ndarray` class),** which satisfy most but *not* all of the
:class:`collections.abc.Sequence` API. Specifically, NumPy arrays fail to
define:

* The ``__reversible__`` dunder method.
* The ``count`` public method.
* The ``index`` public method.

Most callables accepting sequences *never* invoke these edge-case methods and
should thus be typed to accept NumPy arrays as well. To do so, prefer either:

* The :class:`SequenceOrNumpyArrayTypes` tuple of types matching both sequences
  and NumPy arrays.
* The :class:`SequenceMutableOrNumpyArrayTypes` tuple of types matching both
  mutable sequences and NumPy arrays.

# ....................{ TYPES ~ enum                      }....................
# Enumeration types are sufficiently obscure to warrant formalization here.

EnumType = _EnumMeta
'''
Type of all **enumeration types** (i.e., metaclass of all classes containing
all enumeration members comprising those enumerations).

Motivation
----------
This type is commonly used to validate callable parameters as enumerations. In
recognition of its popularity, this type is intentionally named ``EnumType``
rather than ``EnumMetaType``. While the latter *would* technically be less
ambiguous, the former has the advantage of inviting correctness throughout
downstream codebases -- a less abundant resource.

Why? Because *all* enumeration types are instances of this type rather than the
:class:`Enum` class despite being superficially defined as instances of the
:class:`Enum` class. Thanks to metaclass abuse, enumeration types do *not*
adhere to standard Pythonic semantics. Notably, the following non-standard
invariants hold across *all* enumerations:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from enum import Enum
   >>> GyreType = Enum(
   ...     'GyreType', ('THE', 'FALCON', 'CANNOT', 'HEAR', 'THE', 'FALCONER'))
   >>> from beartype import cave
   >>> isinstance(GyreType, Enum)
   False
   >>> isinstance(GyreType, cave.EnumType)
   True
   >>> isinstance(GyreType, cave.ClassType)
   True
   >>> isinstance(GyreType.FALCON, cave.EnumType)
   False
   >>> isinstance(GyreType.FALCON, cave.EnumMemberType)
   True
   >>> isinstance(GyreType.FALCON, cave.ClassType)
   False

Yes, this is insane. Yes, this is Python.
'''


EnumMemberType = _Enum
'''
Type of all **enumeration members** (i.e., abstract base class of all
alternative choices defined as enumeration fields).

Caveats
----------
When type checking callable parameters, this class should *only* be referenced
where the callable permissively accepts any enumeration member type rather than
a specific enumeration member type. In the latter case, that type is simply
that enumeration's type and should be directly referenced as such: e.g.,

    >>> from enum import Enum
    >>> from beartype import beartype
    >>> EndymionType = Enum('EndymionType', ('BEAUTY', 'JOY',))
    >>> @beartype
    ... def our_feet_were_soft_in_flowers(superlative: EndymionType) -> str:

C-based type of all `PEP 585`_-compliant **type hint** (i.e., C-based type hint

BoolType = _BoolType
'''
Type of all **booleans** (i.e., objects defining the ``__bool__()`` dunder
method; objects reducible in boolean contexts like ``if`` conditionals to
either ``True`` or ``False``).

This type matches:

* **Builtin booleans** (i.e., instances of the standard :class:`bool` class
  implemented in low-level C).
* **NumPy booleans** (i.e., instances of the :class:`numpy.bool_` class
  implemented in low-level C and Fortran) if :mod:`numpy` is importable.

Usage
----------
Non-standard boolean types like NumPy booleans are typically *not*
interoperable with the standard standard :class:`bool` type. In particular, it
is typically *not* the case, for any variable ``my_bool`` of non-standard
boolean type and truthy value, that either ``my_bool is True`` or ``my_bool ==
True`` yield the desired results. Rather, such variables should *always* be
coerced into the standard :class:`bool` type before being compared -- either:

* Implicitly (e.g., ``if my_bool: pass``).
* Explicitly (e.g., ``if bool(my_bool): pass``).

Caveats
----------
**There exists no abstract base class governing booleans in Python.** Although
various Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) were authored on the subject, all
were rejected as of this writing. Instead, this type trivially implements an
ad-hoc abstract base class (ABC) detecting objects satisfying the boolean
protocol via structural subtyping. Although no actual real-world classes
subclass this :mod:`beartype`-specific ABC, the detection implemented by this
ABC suffices to match *all* boolean types. So it goes.

StrType = str    # Well, isn't that special.
'''
Type of all **unencoded Unicode strings** (i.e., instances of the builtin
:class:`str` class; sequences of abstract Unicode codepoints that have yet to
be encoded into physical encoded bytes in encoded byte strings).

This type matches:

* **Builtin Unicode strings** (i.e., :class:`str` instances).
* **NumPy Unicode strings** (i.e., :class:`numpy.str_` instances) if
  :mod:`numpy` is importable. Whereas most NumPy scalar types do *not* subclass
  builtin scalar types, the :class:`numpy.str_` class *does* subclass the
  builtin :class:`str` type. NumPy Unicode strings are thus usable wherever
  builtin Unicode strings are usable.

Caveats
----------
This type does *not* match **encoded byte strings** (i.e., sequences of
physical encoded bytes, including the builtin :class:`bytestring` type), which
require foreknowledge of the encoding previously used to encode those bytes.
Unencoded Unicode strings require no such foreknowledge and are thus
incompatible with encoded byte strings at the API level.

This type only matches **builtin Unicode strings** (i.e., :class:`str`
instances) and instances of subtypes of that type (e.g., :class:`numpy.str_`,
the NumPy Unicode string type). Whereas the comparable :class:`BoolType`
matches arbitrary objects satisfying the boolean protocol (i.e., ``__bool__()``
dunder method) via structural subtyping, this type does *not* match arbitrary
objects satisfying the string protocol via structural subtyping -- because
there is no string protocol. While Python's data model does define a
``__str__()`` dunder method called to implicitly convert arbitrary objects into
strings, that method is called infrequently. As exhibited by the infamously
rejected `PEP 3140`_ proposal, the :meth:`list.__str__` implementation
stringifies list items by erroneously calling the unrelated ``__repr__()``
method rather than the expected ``__str__()`` method on those items. Moreover,
``__str__()`` fails to cover common string operations such as string
concatenation and repetition. Covering those operations would require a new
abstract base class (ABC) matching arbitrary objects satisfying the
:class:`Sequence` protocol as well as ``__str__()`` via structural subtyping;
while trivial, that ABC would then ambiguously match all builtin sequence types
(e.g., :class:`list`, :class:`tuple`) as string types, which they clearly are
not. In short, matching only :class:`str` is the *only* unambiguous means of
matching Unicode string types.

Type of all **numbers** (i.e., concrete instances of the abstract

This type effectively matches *all* numbers regardless of implementation,
including:

* **Integers** (i.e., real numbers expressible without fractional components),
  including:
  * **Builtin integers** (i.e., :class:`int` instances).
  * **NumPy integers** (e.g., :class:`numpy.int_` instances), whose types are
    all implicitly registered at :mod:`numpy` importation time as satisfying
    the :class:`numbers.Integral` protocol.
  * **SymPy integers** (e.g., :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Integer` instances),
    whose type is implicitly registered at :mod:`sympy` importation time as
    satisfying the class:`numbers.Integral` protocol.
* **Rational numbers** (i.e., real numbers expressible as the ratio of two
  integers), including:
  * **Builtin floating-point numbers** (i.e., :class:`float` instances).
  * **NumPy floating-point numbers** (e.g., :class:`numpy.single` instances),
    all of which are implicitly registered at :mod:`numpy` importation time as
    :class:`numbers.Rational` subclasses.
  * **Stdlib fractions** (i.e., :class:`fractions.Fraction` instances).
  * **SymPy floating-point numbers** (e.g., :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Float`
    instances), whose type implicitly registered at :mod:`sympy` importation
    time as satisfying the class:`numbers.Real` protocol.
  * **SymPy rational numbers** (e.g., :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Rational`
    instances), whose type implicitly registered at :mod:`sympy` importation
    time as satisfying the class:`numbers.Rational` protocol.
* **Irrational numbers** (i.e., real numbers *not* expressible as the ratio of
  two integers), including:
  * **SymPy irrational numbers** (i.e., SymPy-specific symbolic objects whose
    ``is_irrational`` assumption evaluates to ``True``).

Caveats
----------
This type does *not* match:

* **Stdlib decimals** (i.e., :class:`decimal.Decimal` instances), which support
  both unrounded decimal (i.e., fixed-point arithmetic) and rounded
  floating-point arithmetic. Despite being strictly rational, the
  :class:`decimal.Decimal` class only subclasses the coarse-grained abstract
  :class:`numbers.Number` base superclass rather than the fine-grained abstract
  :class:`numbers.Rational` base subclass. So it goes.
* **SymPy complex numbers,** which are "non-atomic" (i.e., defined as the
  combination of two separate real and imaginary components rather than as one
  unified complex number containing these components) and thus incommensurable
  with all of the above "atomic" types.

This type matches all numbers matched by :class:`NumberType` *except* complex
numbers with non-zero imaginary components, which (as the name implies) are
non-real.

Equivalently, this type matches all integers (e.g., :class:`int`,
:class:`numpy.int_`), floating-point numbers (e.g., :class:`float`,
:class:`numpy.single`), rational numbers (e.g., :class:`fractions.Fraction`,
:class:`sympy.core.numbers.Rational`), and irrational numbers. However,
rational and irrational numbers are rarely used in comparison to integers and
floating-point numbers. This type thus reduces to matching all integer and

NoneTypeOr = _NoneTypeOrType()
'''
**:class:``NoneType`` tuple factory** (i.e., dictionary mapping from arbitrary
types or tuples of types to the same types or tuples of types concatenated with
the type of the ``None`` singleton).

This factory efficiently generates and caches tuples of types containing
:class:``NoneType`` from arbitrary user-specified types and tuples of types. To
do so, simply index this factory with any desired type *or* tuple of types; the
corresponding value will then be another tuple containing :class:``NoneType``
and that type *or* those types.

Motivation
----------
This factory is commonly used to type-hint **optional callable parameters**
(i.e., parameters defaulting to ``None`` when *not* explicitly passed by the
caller). Although such parameters may also be type-hinted with a tuple manually
containing :class:``NoneType``, doing so inefficiently recreates these tuples
for each optional callable parameter across the entire codebase.

This factory avoids such inefficient recreation. Instead, when indexed with any
arbitrary key:

* If that key has already been successfully accessed on this factory, this
  factory returns the existing value (i.e., tuple containing
  :class:``NoneType`` and that key if that key is a type *or* the items of that
  key if that key is a tuple) previously mapped and cached to that key.
* Else, if that key is:

  * A type, this factory:

    #. Creates a new tuple containing that type and :class:``NoneType``.
    #. Associates that key with that tuple.
    #. Returns that tuple.

  * A tuple of types, this factory:

    #. Creates a new tuple containing these types and :class:``NoneType``.
    #. Associates that key with that tuple.
    #. Returns that tuple.

  * Any other object, raises a human-readable
    :class:`beartype.roar.BeartypeCaveNoneTypeOrKeyException` exception.

This factory is analogous to the `PEP 484`_-compliant :class:`typing.Optional`
type despite otherwise *not* complying with `PEP 484`_.

This tuple matches booleans, integers, rational numbers, irrational numbers,
real numbers, and complex numbers.

Booleans are trivially convertible into integers. While details differ by
implementation, common implementations in lower-level languages (e.g., C, C++,
Perl) typically implicitly convert:

* ``False`` to ``0`` and vice versa.
* ``True`` to ``1`` and vice versa.

VersionComparableTypes = (tuple,)
'''
Tuple of all **comparable version types** (i.e., types suitable for use both as
parameters to callables accepting arbitrary version specifiers *and* as
operands to numeric operators comparing such specifiers) if
:mod:`pkg_resources` is importable *or* ``(tuple,)`` otherwise.

This is the proper subset of types listed by the :data:`VersionTypes` tuple
that are directly comparable, thus excluding the :class:`str` type.
``.``-delimited version specifier strings are only indirectly comparable after
conversion to a comparable version type.

Caveats
----------
Note that all types listed by this tuple are *only* safely comparable with
versions of the same type. In particular, the types listed by the
:class:`SetuptoolsVersionTypes` tuple do *not* necessarily support direct
comparison with either the :class:`tuple` *or* `class:`str` version types;
ironically, those types supported both under older but *not* newer versions of
:mod:`setuptools`. This is why we can't have good things.
