#FIXME: [ICON] Define the "html_favicon" setting as well -- once we actually
#create a favicon, of course. *sigh*

#FIXME: [THEME] Consider generalizing our theme from the somewhat low-level
#"pydata-sphinx-theme" theme to the substantially higher-level
#"sphinx-book-theme". The latter is built in terms of the former, but layers on
#additional functionality for interactive Jupyter BinderHub-based cell content.
#That would be just fantastic, because we have so *UTTERLY* much "code-block"
#content distributed across our documentation; rendering that as interactive
#content that users could actually run would be a *HUGE* win. See also:
#    https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-book-theme

#FIXME: [EXTENSION] Add "sphinx-notfound-page" support to enable us to provide
#a sane 404 page for non-existent pages. In fact, we already appear to have a
#"404.rst" document. Well, isn't that noice. Because we can't be bothered to
#configure this at the moment, note that:
#* We've temporarily moved "404.rst" into the parent subdirectory, where it
#  has absolutely no effect (but at least does *NOT* induce fatal errors).
#* We'll need to move "404.rst" back into this subdirectory first.

    # Third-party "autoapi" Sphinx extension actively maintained by Read The
    # Docs (RTD) and an alternative to the builtin "autodoc" Sphinx extension.
    # "autoapi" is strongly preferable to "autodoc" in the modern context, as:
    # * "autodoc" dynamically imports *ALL* Python modules to be documented and
    #   thus executes *ALL* module-scoped code in those modules at documentation
    #   time, significantly complicating documentation time in the event of
    #   module-scoped code *NOT* expected to be executed at documentation time.
    #   Conversely, "autoapi" simply statically parses the same modules and thus
    #   entirely circumvents the arbitrary code execution "pain point."
    # * "autosummary" (another builtin Sphinx extension typically used to
    #   conjunction with "autodoc" to generate table of contents (TOC) entries)
    #   defaults to a silent noop; even when configured to generate non-empty
    #   content, however, "autosummary" fails to document class- or
    #   module-scoped attributes due to long-standing Sphinx limitations.
    #   Conversely, "autoapi" generates usable TOC entries out-of-the-box with
    #   *NO* configuration or kludges required.

    #FIXME: Temporarily disabled in a pell-mell rush to host our "README.rst"
    #file on RTD. Once we finish that laborious process, let's revisit

#FIXME: As expected, this is ignored. Until resolved, let's try temporarily

#Issue, please!

# Increase the maximum number of links displayed by "pydata-sphinx-theme" in the
# top-most navigation bar. "pydata-sphinx-theme" displays all remaining links in
# a dropdown entitled "More" that, when clicked, vertically lists those links.
# "pydata-sphinx-theme" defaults this global to 5, which is insufficient for the
# larger number of links required for this documentation.
