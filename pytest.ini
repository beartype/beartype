# To permit tests to transparently import from the main non-test codebase, this
# file resides in the root project directory. pytest then:
#
# 1. Recursively finds this file.
# 2. Sets "config.inifile" to the absolute path of this file.
# 3. Sets "config.rootdir" to the absolute path of this file's directory.
#
# See https://pytest.org/latest/customize.html for details.

# The following pytest-specific section specifier is mandatory, despite this
# file's unambiguous basename of "pytest.ini". One is enraged by bureaucracy!

# Newline-delimited list of all custom warning filters applied by this test
# suite. Recognized strings include:
# * "default", printing the first occurrence of matching warnings for each
#   location (module + line number) where the warning is issued.
#   Unsurprisingly, this is pytest's default. Surprisingly, the resulting
#   output is overly fine-grained to the point of stripping all caller context
#   and thus being mostly useless: e.g.,
#       betse_test/func/sim/solve/test_sim_fast.py::test_cli_sim_fast
#         /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/numpy/core/_asarray.py:83: VisibleDeprecationWarning: Creating an ndarray from ragged nested sequences (which is a list-or-tuple of lists-or-tuples-or ndarrays with different lengths or shapes) is deprecated. If you meant to do this, you must specify 'dtype=object' when creating the ndarray
#           return array(a, dtype, copy=False, order=order)
#   Note that pytest reports the warning as originating from within a private
#   NumPy submodule, which it technically does but which communicates no
#   practical meaning with respect to our codebase.
# * "error", turning matching warnings into exceptions. Ideally, pytest would
#   support a filter printing tracebacks on warnings. Since it fails to do so,
#   implicitly printing tracebacks by coercing non-fatal warnings into fatal
#   exceptions is our next best least worst solution.
filterwarnings =
    # Implicitly coerce all non-fatal warnings into fatal exceptions.
    error

    # Avoid coercing all non-fatal warnings matching one or more of the
    # following patterns formatted as:
    #     ignore:{warning_message}:{warning_classname}:{module_name}
    #
    # ...where:
    # * "{warning_message}" is a regular expression matching the plaintext of
    #   the warning message to be ignored.
    # * "{warning_classname}" is the fully-qualified classname of the warning
    #   to be ignored.
    # * "{module_name}" is the fully-qualified name of the module emitting the
    #   warning to be ignored.
    #
    # For example:
    #     ignore:^Use of \.\. or absolute path in a resource path.*:DeprecationWarning:pkg_resources
    #
    # See also:
    # * https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html and
    # * https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/warnings.html

# Newline-delimited list of all custom marks applied by this test suite.
# Failing to explicitly list such marks here induces non-fatal warnings: e.g.,

# ....................{ OPTIONS                             }...................
#FIXME: Conditionally support the following plugin-based options in an
#appropriate setuptools command when the requisite plugin is importable:
#
#* "--instafail", immediately printing test output rather than delaying such
#  output until after all tests complete. This requires the "pytest-instafail"
#  plugin. Note that this may not necessarily play nicely with the
#  "--capture=no" option leveraged below. Consider further testing.
#FIXME: Pass "--ff" and "--tb=auto" when all test machines have a sufficiently
#new version of pytest installed.

# Unconditionally pass the following command-line options to all invocations of
# the "pytest" command. Dismantled, this is:
#
# * "-v", increasing verbosity.
# * "--full-trace", printing a full traceback on keyboard interrupts (e.g.,
#   hitting <Ctrl-C> during testing at the command line).
# * "-p no:xvfb", disabling the "pytest-xvfb" plugin for this CLI-only project.
#   Although technically harmless, this plugin unconditionally logs extraneous
#   messages that hamper readability of pytest output. Ergo, it goes.
# * "-r a", increasing verbosity of (a)ll types of test summaries.
# * "-s", disable all stdout and stderr capturing.
# * "--doctest-glob=", disabling implicit detection of doctests (i.e., tests
#   embedded in docstrings that double as human-readable examples). By default,
#   pytest runs all files matching the recursive glob "**/test*.txt" through
#   the standard "doctest" module. Since this project employs explicit tests
#   rather than implicit doctests, this detection is a non-fatal noop in the
#   best case and a fatal conflict in the worst case. For collective sanity,
#   this detection *MUST* be disabled.
# * "--failed-first", prioritizing tests that failed ahead of tests that
#   succeeded on the most recent test run. Actually, this option has been
#   temporarily omitted. Why? Because serial tests currently fail to implicitly
#   require prerequisite tests (e.g., "test_cli_sim_default[sim]" fails to
#   require "test_cli_sim_default[seed]"), thus requiring that tests be run
#   *ONLY* in the default ordering.
# * "--showlocals", printing local variable values in tracebacks.
# * "--tb=native", printing tracebacks in the same manner as tracebacks printed
#   by Python itself for uncaught exceptions. By default, pytest prints
#   tracebacks in an extremely colourful (which is nice) but unreadable (which
#   is *NOT* nice) manner.
#
# See "pytest --help | less" for further details on available options.
