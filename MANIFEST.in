# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Template with which setuptools generates this project's "MANIFEST" file.

# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: Add a new functional test exercising the correctness of this file,
#probably by manually running a shell command resembling:
#    $ python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
#...where "python3" should be replaced by the command invoking the active
#Python interpreter. It's likely that we'll then have to parse the output of
#that command for lines suggestive of syntactic errors in this file. *shrug*

# ....................{ INCLUDE                            }....................
# Include all requisite top-level install-time files.
