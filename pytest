# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Bash shell script wrapping this project's pytest-based test suite, passing
# sane default options suitable for interactive terminal testing and otherwise
# passing all passed arguments as is to the "pytest" command.
#
# This script is defined as a Bash rather than Bourne script purely for the
# canonical ${BASH_SOURCE} string global, reliably providing the absolute
# pathnames of this script and hence this script's directory.
#
# --------------------( CAVEATS                            )--------------------
# *THE HIGHER-LEVEL "tox" SCRIPT SHOULD TYPICALLY BE RUN INSTEAD.* This
# lower-level script only exercises this project against the single Python
# interpreter associated with the "pytest" command and is thus suitable *ONLY*
# as a rapid sanity check. Meanwhile, the higher-level "tox" command exercises
# this project against all installed Python interpreters and is thus suitable
# as a full-blown correctness check (e.g., before submitting pull requests).

# If the third-party "coverage" package is installed under the desired Python

#
# If the "-k" option was passed, we avoid measuring coverage. Why? Because that
# option restricts testing to a subset of tests, guaranteeing that coverage
# measurements will be misleading at best and trigger test failure at worst
# (e.g., if the "fail_under" option is enabled in ".coveragerc").

    # If run this project's pytest-based test suite with all passed arguments
    # (while measuring coverage) succeeds, generate a terminal coverage report.
    #
    # Note that the last argument passed to "pytest" *MUST* be ".". Why?
    # Because "." notifies pytest of the relative dirname of the root directory
    # for this project. On startup, pytest internally:
    # * Sets its "rootdir" property to this dirname in absolute form.
    # * Sets its "inifile" property to the concatenation of this dirname
    #   with the basename "pytest.ini" if that top-level configuration file
    #   exists.
    # * Prints the initial values of these properties to stdout.
    #
    # *THIS IS ESSENTIAL.* If *NOT* explicitly passed this dirname as an
    # argument, pytest may fail to set these properties to the expected
    # pathnames. For unknown reasons (presumably unresolved pytest issues),
    # pytest instead sets "rootdir" to the absolute dirname of the current
    # user's home directory and "inifile" to "None". Since no user's home
    # directory contains a "pytest.ini" file, pytest then prints errors ala:
    #    $ ./pytest -k test_sim_export --export-sim-conf-dir ~/tmp/yolo
