#     with some of the required packages Python requirement:
#       - beartype requires Python !=3.14.0rc1,!=3.14.0rc2,>=3.10, so it will
#         not be installable for Python 3.14.0rc1 || 3.14.0rc2
#
# Synchronizing these two versions will be a pain point, but is certainly
# preferable to Poetry refusing to install future versions of beartype.
