# If the third-party "docutils" package satisfying this minimum version is
# unavailable, skip this test. Note that:
#
# * "docutils" is the reference standard for parsing reStructuredText (reST).
#   Unsurprisingly, even Sphinx parses reST with "docutils".
# * This test makes assumptions about the "docutils" public API satisfied
#   *ONLY* by this minimum version.
