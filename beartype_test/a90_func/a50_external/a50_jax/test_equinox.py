# WARNING: To raise human-readable test errors, avoid importing from
# package-specific submodules at module scope.
#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# WARNING: To avoid inscrutable issues with previously run unit tests requiring
# forked subprocess isolation, avoid attempting to conditionally skip
# JAX-dependent integration tests with standard mark decorators: e.g.,
#     @skip_unless_package('jax')  # <-- *NEVER DO THIS* srsly. never.
#     @skip_unless_package('jaxtyping')  # <-- *NEVER DO THIS EITHER* bad is bad
#
# Why? Because even the mere act of attempting to decide whether JAX is
# importable at early test collection time causes the first unit test isolated
# to a forked subprocess to raise the following suspicious exception:
# E       pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning: Exception ignored in:
#         <function _at_fork at 0x7f3865738310>
# E       Traceback (most recent call last):
# E         File "/home/leycec/py/conda/envs/ionyou_dev/lib/python3.11/site-packages/jax/_src/xla_bridge.py", line 112, in _at_fork
# E           warnings.warn(
# E       RuntimeWarning: os.fork() was called. os.fork() is incompatible
#         with multithreaded code, and JAX is multithreaded, so this will
#         likely lead to a deadlock.
