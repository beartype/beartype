Project-wide **Sphinx** integration tests.

    Functional test validating that the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator
    conditionally reduces to a noop when the active Python interpreter is

#FIXME: For unknown reasons, this currently fails despite working for literally
#years. The culprit is almost certainly the "sphinx.testing.fixtures" API, which
#has yet to be properly documented. That said, we've personally validated that
#this API does still define the expected "make_app" fixture. So, it's unclear
#exactly why our GitHub Actions-based continuous integration (CI) workflow is
#complaining about that fixture being undefined:
