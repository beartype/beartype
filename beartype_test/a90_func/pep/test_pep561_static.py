#FIXME: Consider submitting as a StackOverflow post. Dis iz l33t, yo!
#FIXME: Sadly, diz iz no longer l33t. Mypy broke its runtime API. This test now
#spuriously fails under CI with a non-human-readable exception message
#resembling:
#       TypeError: 'mypy' is not a package
#
#The solution? Refactor this test ala the existing test_pep561_pyright() test,
#which thankfully already does everything we want here. Rejoice!

# If the third-party "mypy" package is unavailable, skip this test. Note that:
# * "mypy" is the reference standard for static type-checking in Python.
# * Unbelievably, "mypy" violates PEP 8 versioning standards by failing to
#   define the "mypy.__init__.__version__" attribute, which means that passing
#   the optional "minimum_version" parameter to the skip_unless_package()
#   decorator fails on failing to find that attribute. While we *COULD* instead
#   explicitly test the "mypy.version.__version__" attribute, doing so would
#   require defining a new and *MUCH* less trivial
#   @skip_unless_module_attribute decorator. For sanity, we instead currently
#   accept the importability of the "mypy" package as sufficient, which it
#   absolutely isn't, but what you gonna do, right?
#
# Skip this "mypy"-specific functional test unless all of the following apply:
# * The "mypy" package is importable under the active Python interpreter.
# * Tests are *NOT* running remotely under GitHub Actions-based continuous
#   integration (CI). Since our CI workflow already explicitly exercises this
#   package against "mypy", explicitly exercising this package against "mypy"
#   yet again would only needlessly complicate CI workflows and consume excess
#   CI minutes for *NO* gain.
# * The active Python interpreter is *NOT* PyPy. mypy is currently incompatible
#   with PyPy for inscrutable reasons that should presumably be fixed at some
#   future point. See also:
#     https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#does-it-run-on-pypy

    #
    # Note that "mypy" predominantly emits both warnings and errors to "stdout"
    # rather than "stderr", despite this contravening sane POSIX semantics.
    # They did this because some guy complained about not being able to
    # trivially grep "mypy" output, regardless of the fact that redirecting
    # stderr to stdout is a trivial shell fragment (e.g., "2>&1"), but let's
    # break everything just because some guy can't shell. See also:
    #     https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1051
    #
    # Assert "mypy" to have emitted *NO* warnings or errors to "stdout".
    # Unfortunately, doing so is complicated by the failure of "mypy" to
    # conform to sane POSIX semantics. Specifically:
    # * If "mypy" succeeds, "mypy" emits to "stdout" a single line resembling:
    #       Success: no issues found in 83 source files
    # * If "mypy" fails, "mypy" emits to "stdout" *ANY* other line(s).
    #
    # Ergo, asserting this string to start with "Success:" suffices. Note this
    # assertion depends on "mypy" internals and is thus fragile, but that we
    # have *NO* sane alternative. Specifically, if either...
    if (
        # Mypy emitted one or more characters to standard error *OR*...
        mypy_stderr or
        # Mypy emitted standard output that does *NOT* contain this substring...

        # then captures and reprints on this subsequent assertion failure.

# If the external third-party "pyright" command is *NOT* pathable (i.e., an
# executable command residing in the ${PATH} of the local filesystem), skip this
# test. Note that:
# * "pyright" is the most popular static type-checker for Python, mostly due to
#   "pylance" (i.e., the most popular Python language plugin for VSCode, itself
#   the most popular integrated development environment (IDE)) both bundling
#   *AND* enabling "pyright" by default.
# * "pyright" is implemented in pure-TypeScript (i.e., JavaScript augmented with
#   type hints transpiling down to pure-JavaScript at compilation time).
# * There exists a largely unrelated "pyright" Python package shim unofficially
#   published at:
#    https://github.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python
#   Sadly, that package does fundamentally unsafe things like:
#   * Violating privacy encapsulation of "pytest", repeatedly.
#   * Performing online "npm"-based auto-installation of the "pyright"
#     JavaScript package if currently not installed. Currently, there exists
#     *NO* means of disabling that dubious behavior.
#   Ergo, we resoundingly ignore that high-level package in favour of the
#   low-level "pyright" command. Such is quality assurance. It always hurts.
#
# Skip this "pyright"-specific functional test unless all of the following
# apply:
# * The "pyright" command is in the current "${PATH}".
# * Tests are *NOT* running remotely under GitHub Actions-based continuous
#   integration (CI). Since the only sane means of installing "pyright" under
#   GitHub Actions is via the third-party "jakebailey/pyright-action" action
#   (which implicitly exercises this package against "pyright"), explicitly
#   exercising this package against "pyright" yet again would only needlessly
#   complicate CI workflows and consume excess CI minutes for *NO* gain.
