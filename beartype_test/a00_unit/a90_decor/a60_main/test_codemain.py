    '''
    Test the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator with respect to type-checking
    code dynamically generated by the :mod:`beartype._decor._wrapper.wrappermain`
    submodule.

    This unit test effectively acts as a functional test and is thus the core
    test exercising decorator functionality from the end user perspective --
    the only perspective that matters in the end. Unsurprisingly, this test is
    mildly more involved than most. *Whatevah.*

    This test additionally attempts to avoid similar issues to a `prior issue
    <issue #5_>`__ of this decorator induced by repeated
    :func:`beartype.beartype` decorations of different callables annotated by
    one or more of the same PEP-compliant type hints.
