**Beartype decorator mypy-compliant type hint unit tests.**

This submodule unit tests the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator with respect
to :mod:`mypy`-compliant type hints (i.e., type hints that are *not* explicitly
PEP-compliant but are effectively PEP-compliant due to being accepted by
:mod:`mypy`, the de-facto type-hinting standard).
