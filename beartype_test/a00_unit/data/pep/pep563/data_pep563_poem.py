Project-wide :pep:`563` **poetic data submodule.**

This submodule exercises :pep:`563` support implemented in the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator by enabling this support with a leading
``from __future__ import annotations`` statement and then declaring a callable
decorated by that decorator. External unit tests are expected to conditionally
import this submodule if the active Python interpreter targets at least
Python 3.7.0 and then call that callable.

Caveats
----------
**This submodule requires the active Python interpreter to target at least
Python 3.7.0.** If this is *not* the case, importing this submodule raises an
:class:`AttributeError` exception.

    'To cure it of sorrow would destroy it. The sorrow is part of its own private task. We cannot interfere.',
    'Sometimes when they are deep in dreams, I want to tell them, they are building true worlds in reality. Sometimes I want to tell them of their importance to the universe. Sometimes, when they have not made a true connection in a while, I want to help them to speak the word they fear.',

    'The player was you, {player_name}.',

The ball of molten rock circled a ball of blazing gas that was three hundred and thirty thousand times more massive than it. They were so far apart that light took eight minutes to cross the gap. The light was information from a star, and it could burn your skin from a hundred and fifty million kilometres away.',
    'Sometimes the player dreamed it was a miner, on the surface of a world that was flat, and infinite. The sun was a square of white. The days were short; there was much to do; and death was a temporary inconvenience.',
    'Sometimes the player dreamed it was lost in a story.',
    'Sometimes the player dreamed it was other things, in other places. Sometimes these dreams were disturbing. Sometimes very beautiful indeed. Sometimes the player woke from one dream into another, then woke from that into a third.',
    'Sometimes the player dreamed it watched words on a screen.',
    "Let's go back.",
    'The atoms of the player were scattered in the grass, in the rivers, in the air, in the ground. A woman gathered the atoms; she drank and ate and inhaled; and the woman assembled the player, in her body.',
    "And the player awoke, from the warm, dark world of its mother's body, into the long dream.",
    'And the player was a new story, never told before, written in letters of DNA. And the player was a new program, never run before, generated by a sourcecode a billion years old. And the player was a new human, never alive before, made from nothing but milk and love.',

    "Let's go further back.",
    "The seven billion billion billion atoms of the player's body were created, long before this game, in the heart of a star. So the player, too, is information from a star. And the player moves through a story, which is a forest of information planted by a man called Julian, on a flat, infinite world created by a man called Markus, that exists inside a small, private world created by the player, who inhabits a universe created by...",

Sometimes it built a model of the universe in its head; flecks of energy, moving through vast empty spaces. Sometimes it called those flecks "electrons" and "protons".',
