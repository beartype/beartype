Project-wide **beartype import hookable** :pep:`695` **submodule** (i.e., data
module containing *only* :pep:`695`-compliant type aliases and callables and
classes annotated by those aliases, mimicking real-world usage of the
:func:`beartype.claw.beartype_package` import hook on an external package
utilizing type aliases).

This submodule *only* exercises **forward referencing type aliases** (i.e.,
:pep:`695`-compliant ``type`` statements containing one or more unquoted
relative forward references). Due to deficiencies in CPython's low-level C-based
implementation of :pep:`695`-compliant type aliases, type-checking forward
reference type aliases requires abstract syntax tree (AST) transformations and
thus beartype import hooks.

Caveats
-------
**This submodule requires the active Python interpreter to target at least
Python 3.12.0.** If this is *not* the case, importing this submodule raises an
:exc:`SyntaxError` exception.

    Standard workflow defining all other type aliases to be tested, whose
    type-checking does *not* require AST transformations.

# * Embed the same unquoted relative forward reference multiple times in the

    #FIXME: *BIG YIKES.* CPython's low-level C-based implementation of PEP
    #695-compliant type aliases currently fails to properly resolve unquoted
    #relative forward references defined in a local rather than global scope. I
    #tried literally everything to get this to work via AST transformations --
    #but whatever arcane type alias machinery it is that they've implemented
    #simply does *NOT* behave as expected at local scope. That said, we've
    #verified this *SHOULD* work via this simple snippet:
    #    >>> type bar = wut
    #    >>> globals()['wut'] = str
    #    >>> print(bar.__value__)
    #    str
    #
    #That behaves as expected -- until you actually then define the expected
    #class at local scope:
    #    def foo():
    #        type bar = wut
    #        globals()['wut'] = str
    #        print(bar.__value__)
    #        class wut(object): pass  # <-- this causes madness; WTF!?!?!?
    #    foo()
    #

    #resembling:
    #    NameError: cannot access free variable 'wut' where it is not associated
    #    with a value in enclosing scope
    #
    #Clearly, this is madness. At the point at which the print() statement is
    #run, the "wut" class has yet to be redefined as a class. This constitutes a
    #profound CPython bug. Please submit us up the F-F-F-bomb.
