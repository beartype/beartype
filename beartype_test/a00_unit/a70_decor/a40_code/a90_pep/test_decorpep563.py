# WARNING: To raise human-readable test errors, avoid importing from
# package-specific submodules at module scope.
# WARNING: The "from __future__ import annotations" import appears to be subtly
# broken under Python >= 3.10, where performing that import prevents the
# "f_locals" attribute of stack frames from capturing locals defined by parent
# callables and accessed *ONLY* in type hints annotating one or more parameters
# of nested callables contained in those parent callables. Oddly, this breakage
# does *NOT* extend to type hints annotating returns of those nested callables
# -- only parameters. Ergo, we can only conclude this to be a subtle bug. We
# should probably issue an upstream CPython report. For now, conditionally
# disable *ALL* PEP 563-specific tests importing from another module containing
# an "from __future__ import annotations" import.

#FIXME: *REPORT AN UPSTREAM ISSUE WITH THE PYPY TRACKER AT:*
#    https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/issues
#
#So, what's going on here? What's going on here is that PyPy appears to be
#slightly broken with respect to the "FrameType.f_locals" dictionary. Whereas
#CPython provides the actual dictionary of lexically scoped locals required by
#the current frame, PyPy only dynamically computes that dictionary on-the-fly.
#This dynamic computation is known to fail cross-thread but was assumed to be
#fully compliant with CPython expectations when running in the same thread.
#
#This does *NOT* appear to be the case. Specifically, the "IntLike" local
#variable declared by the top-level get_minecraft_end_txt_closure_factory()
#function is:
#* Correctly accessible to the lowest-level
#  get_minecraft_end_txt_closure_inner() closure with respect to actual
#  interpretation of statements and thus declaration of closures by PyPy.
#* Incorrectly omitted from the "FrameType.f_locals" dictionary of the frame
#  object for the mid-level get_minecraft_end_txt_closure_outer() closure
#  declaring the lowest-level get_minecraft_end_txt_closure_inner() closure.
#  What's bizarre is that that dictionary correctly includes the "player_name"
#  parameter accepted by the top-level get_minecraft_end_txt_closure_factory()
#  function.
#
#Clearly, what's happening here is that PyPy developers failed to add local
#variables of lexical scopes declared by distant parent callables (i.e.,
#callables that are *NOT* the direct parent of the lowest-level closure in
#question) when those local variables are *ONLY* accessed in annotations.
#Moreover, when those local variables are accessed outside annotations (as
#with the "player_name" parameter) in the body of the lowest-level closure,
#those variables are correctly added to the "FrameType.f_locals" dictionary.
#Ergo, this is an annotation-specific issue in the internal algorithm PyPy
#uses to dynamically construct that dictionary on-the-fly. Admittedly, this was
#an edge case that basically didn't matter until PEP 563 landed -- at which
#point this edge case *REALLY* mattered.
#FIXME: CPython is subtly broken with respect to "from __future__ import
#annotations" imports under Python >= 3.10. Until resolved, disable this.
