    Test unsuccessful usage of a wrapper function dynamically generated by the
    :func:`beartype.decorator` decorator to type-check a function accepting a
    deeply nested data structure, passed a worst-case structure exposing
    performance regressions in this wrapper function.

    This test guards against performance regressions in an `issue kindly

    #after failing to pass for a certain reasonable duration of time).
    #Pragmatically, pytest provides no official means of doing so and, while
    #unofficial pytest plugins purporting to do so do exist (e.g.,
    #"pytest-timeouts"), all of those plugins come with uncomfortable caveats
    #that effectively render any timeouts-based workflow fragile, non-portable,
    #and failure-prone. Instead, we simply test for timeout in the hackiest
    #way possible -- which is why we exclude this test from remote CI hosts.

    # below passed the worst-called structure defined below is automatically
