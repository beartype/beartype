'''
Project-wide **pathable utilities** (i.e., callables querying commands residing
in the current ``${PATH}`` and hence executable by specifying merely their
basename rather than either relative or absolute path).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

def is_pathable(command_basename: str) -> bool:
    '''
    ``True`` only if a **pathable** (i.e., external command with the passed
    basename corresponding to an executable file in the current ``${PATH}``)
    exists.

    Caveats
    ----------
    For safety, avoid appending the passed basename by a platform-specific
    filetype -- especially, a Windows-specific filetype. On that platform, this
    function iteratively appends this basename by each filetype associated with
    executable files listed by the ``%PATHEXT%`` environment variable (e.g.,
    ``.bat``, ``.cmd``, ``.com``, ``.exe``) until the resulting basename is
    that of an executable file in the current ``%PATH%``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    command_basename : str
        Basename of the command to be searched for.

    Returns
    ----------
    bool
        ``True`` only if this pathable exists.

    Raises
    ----------
    BeartypeTestPathException
        If the passed string is *not* a basename (i.e., contains one or more
        directory separators).
