'''
Project-wide **command runners** (i.e., callables running external commands as
subprocesses of the active Python process).

This private submodule is *not* intended for importation by downstream callers.

Command Words Arguments
----------
Most runners accept a mandatory ``command_words`` parameter, a list of one or
more shell words comprising this command whose:

* Mandatory first item is either:

  * This command's absolute or relative path.
  * This command's basename, in which case the first command with that basename
    in the current ``${PATH}`` environment variable will be run. If no such
    command is found, an exception is raised.

* Optional subsequent items are this command's arguments (in order). Note that
  these arguments are passed as is to a low-level system call rather than
  intprereted by a high-level shell (e.g., ``/bin/sh`` on POSIX-compatible
  platforms) and hence should *not* be shell-quoted. Indeed, shell quoting
  these arguments is likely to result in erroneous command behaviour. The
  principal exception to this heuristic are **GNU-style long value options**
  (i.e., ``--``-prefixed options accepting a ``=``-delimited value), whose
  values should either be:

  * Passed as a separate argument *without* being shell-quoted.
  * Concatenated to the current ``--``-prefixed argument delimited by ``=`` and
    shell-quoted.

``Popen()`` Keyword Arguments
----------
Most runners accept the same optional keyword arguments accepted by the
:meth:`subprocess.Popen.__init__` constructor, including:

* ``cwd``, the absolute path of the current working directory (CWD) from which
  this command is to be run. Defaults to the current CWD. **Unfortunately, note
  that this keyword argument appears to be erroneously ignored on numerous
  platforms (e.g., Windows XP).** For safety, a context manager temporarily
  changing the current directory should typically be leveraged instead.
* ``timeout``, the maximum number of milliseconds this command is to be run
  for. Commands with execution time exceeding this timeout will be mercifully
  killed. Defaults to ``None``, in which case this command is run indefinitely.

Reading from a line-buffered subprocess is guaranteed to block until the
subprocess emits a newline, at which point all output emitted between that
newline inclusive and the prior newline exclusive is consumed.

    '''
    Sanitized dictionary of all keyword arguments to pass to the
    :class:`subprocess.Popen` callable when running the command specified by
    the passed shell words with the passed user-defined keyword arguments.

    Caveats
    ----------
    If the current platform is vanilla Windows *and* none of the ``stdin``,
    ``stdout``, ``stderr``, or ``close_fds`` parameters are passed, this
    function defaults the ``close_fds`` parameter if unpassed to ``False``.
    Doing so causes this command to inherit all file handles (including stdin,
    stdout, and stderr) from the active Python process. Note that the
    :class:`subprocess.Popen` docstring insists that:

        On Windows, if ``close_fds`` is ``True`` then no handles will be
        inherited by the child process.

    The child process will then open new file handles for stdin, stdout, and
    stderr. If the current terminal is a Windows Console, the underlying
    terminal devices and hence file handles will remain the same, in which case
    this is *not* an issue. If the current terminal is Cygwin-based (e.g.,
    MinTTY), however, the underlying terminal devices and hence file handles
    will differ, in which case this behaviour prevents interaction between the
    current shell and the vanilla Windows command to be run below. In
    particular, all output from this command will be squelched.

    If at least one of stdin, stdout, or stderr are redirected to a blocking
    pipe, setting ``close_fds`` to ``False`` can induce deadlocks under certain
    edge-case scenarios. Since all such file handles default to ``None`` and
    hence are *not* redirected in this case, ``close_fds`` may be safely set to
    ``False``.

    On all other platforms, if ``close_fds`` is ``True``, no file handles
    *except* stdin, stdout, and stderr will be inherited by the child process.
    This function fundamentally differs in subtle (and only slightly documented
    ways) between vanilla Windows and all other platforms. These discrepancies
    appear to be harmful but probably unavoidable, given the philosophical gulf
    between vanilla Windows and all other platforms.
