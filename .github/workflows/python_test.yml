# GitHub-specific continuous integration (CI) configuration, enabling the usual
# GitHub Actions workflow for pure-Python packages exercised by "tox".

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Add support for caching "pip" downloads across runs. Currently,
#unresolved issues in GitHub Actions prevents sane caching of "pip" downloads.
#Naturally, horrifying hacks circumventing these issues do exist but are
#presumably worse than these issues. See also this pertinent comment:
#    https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/342#issuecomment-673371329

#FIXME: Consider adding support for Bandit, a security linter. Bandit's
#probably useless here, as we're thoroughly unrelated to web apps. Still, it
#probably can't hurt and might even help us somewhen. *shrug*
