permissions:
  # Permit third-party GitHub Actions to read the contents of this repository's
  # ".git/" subdirectory (e.g., to list all git commits). This is the safest
  # explicit permission that a GitHub workflow can currently grant to
  # third-party GitHub Actions. Ideally, this permission would be the default.
  # According to the CodeQL code scanner, however, this is *NOT* the case.
  # CodeQL security alerts document that:
  #     If a GitHub Actions job or workflow has no explicit permissions set,
  #     then the repository permissions are used. Repositories created under
  #     organizations inherit the organization permissions. The organizations or
  #     repositories created before February 2023 have the default permissions
  #     set to read-write. Often these permissions do not adhere to the
  #     principle of least privilege and can be reduced to read-only, leaving
  #     the write permission only to a specific types as issues: write or
  #     pull-requests: write.
  #
  # Explicitly granting this permission elides both this CodeQL security alert
  # and the underlying insecurity described by this alert.

        #   truncates *ALL* ignorable zeroes suffixing that number (e.g.,
