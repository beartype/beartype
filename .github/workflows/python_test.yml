#FIXME: [CACHING] Add support for caching "pip" downloads across runs.
#Currently, unresolved issues in GitHub Actions prevents sane caching of "pip"
#downloads. Naturally, horrifying hacks circumventing these issues do exist but
#are presumably worse than these issues. See also this pertinent comment:
#    https://github.com/actions/cache/issues/342#issuecomment-673371329
#FIXME: [CACHING] Huzzah! The "setup-python" action itself now supports
#out-of-the-box caching. Note that doing so will require a minor of
#configuration on our part -- but nothing *TOO* tremendous, hopefully. See:
#    https://github.com/actions/setup-python#caching-packages-dependencies

        #   and macOS are both POSIX-compliant and thus crudely comparable from

        #   thus heavily divergent from both macOS and Linux.

        #   need to exercise tests on macOS, given the platform's patent
        #   POSIX-compliant low-level similarities to Linux, but... what the

        # Note that:
        # * Python version specifiers *MUST* be quoted: e.g.,

        #     # Do *NOT* do this.
        #     python-version: 3.10
        #   Why? Because YAML sensibly treats an unquoted literal satisfying
        #   floating-point syntax as a floating-point number and thus silently
        #   truncates *ALL* ignorable zeroes suffixing that number (e.g.,
        #   truncating 3.10 to 3.1). That then results in non-human-readable CI
