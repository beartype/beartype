# GitHub-specific continuous deployment (CD) configuration, enabling automated
# publication of both source tarballs and binary wheels in various popular
# formats to both GitHub itself and PyPI on each push of a tag to the "master"
# branch of this repository.

    #FIXME: *URGH!* "create-release" is now officially dead, so we need to
    #refactor this as quickly as feasible to leverage an alternate action. See
