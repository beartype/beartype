# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Project-wide tox configuration, applied to all invocations of the tox test
# harness within this project.
#
# tox is a high-level Python-specific testing utility wrapping comparatively
# lower-level Python-specific testing frameworks (e.g., py.test, unittest2).
# Whereas the latter only exercise this project's codebase from the current
# working directory (CWD) without installing this project and hence exercising
# this project's installation, tox exercises both.
#
# Specifically, tox iteratively:
# 1. Creates a source-based tarball distribution of this project (e.g., via
#    "python setup.py sdist").
# 2. Installs this tarball *AND* a system-agnostic Python interpreter into one
#    isolated virtual environment for each testing configuration.
# 3. Tests this installation with the specified testing framework.
#

# *THIS CONFIGURATION IS INTOLERANT OF UNICODE CHARACTERS.* Note that setting
# "PYIOENCODING = UTF-8" under the "setenv" section below has no meaningful
# effect. For unknown reasons, "tox" is incapable of processing UTF-8 here.
# This is why nobody gets good things. If this file contains one or more
# UTF-8-encoded characters, "tox" fails with a non-human-readable traceback:
