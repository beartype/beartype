# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Project-wide tox configuration, applied to all invocations of the tox test
# harness within this project.
#
# tox is a high-level Python-specific testing utility wrapping comparatively
# lower-level Python-specific testing frameworks (e.g., py.test, unittest2).
# Whereas the latter only exercise this project's codebase from the current
# working directory (CWD) without installing this project and hence exercising
# this project's installation, tox exercises both.
#
# Specifically, tox iteratively:
# 1. Creates a source-based tarball distribution of this project (e.g., via
#    "python setup.py sdist").
# 2. Installs this tarball *AND* a system-agnostic Python interpreter into one
#    isolated virtual environment for each testing configuration.
# 3. Tests this installation with the specified testing framework.
#
# --------------------( CAVEATS                            )--------------------
# *THIS CONFIGURATION DOES NOT SUPPORT PARALLELIZATION.* Although "tox" can be
# configured to run "tox" environments in parallel, doing so is fraught with
# hardship, produces unreadable output in the best of circumstances, and invites
# non-trivial race conditions between competing "tox" environments. It's best
# *NOT* to go there at all. Anyone requiring parallelization should simply be
# running our GitHub Actions-based "tests" workflow instead, which implicitly
# runs tests in a sane, safe, paralellized manner.
#
# *THIS CONFIGURATION IS INTOLERANT OF UNICODE CHARACTERS.* Note that setting
# "PYIOENCODING = UTF-8" under the "setenv" section below has no meaningful
# effect. For unknown reasons, "tox" is incapable of processing UTF-8 here.
# This is why nobody gets good things. If this file contains one or more
# UTF-8-encoded characters, "tox" fails with a non-human-readable traceback:
#     Traceback (most recent call last):

# * Expands a prefixing "py" to "python".
# * Expands a suffixing "t" to the free-threading GIL-free variant of that
#   interpreter.
# * Delimits the subsequent two digits with a dot to associate each resulting
#   test configuration with the basename of an external command running an
#   externally installed Python interpreter.
# * Expands "-"-delimited lists via the Cartesian set product A x B,
#   effectively "multiplying" each environment on the left of each "-" against
#   each environment on the right of that "-". Moreover, each such environment
#   remains preserved and thus distinctly testable as that environment.
#
# Notable "tox" environments defined below include:
# * The "init" environment, run before *ALL* other "tox" environments and thus
#   preparing the local filesystem for those subsequently run environments.
# * The "py"-prefixed environment group, which "tox" expands via the rules above
#   into the test matrix of *ALL* Python interpreters to be tested.
# * The "finally" environment, run *AFTER* all other "tox" environments and thus
#   aggregating results produced by those previously run environments onto the
#   local filesystem.
#
# Order is typically important between "tox" environments. Thankfully, this
# order may be specified via the "depends =" setting in each "tox" environment.
#
# For example, setting "envlist = py27,py38" produces a test matrix exercising
# the externally installed "python2.7" and "python3.8" commands. See also:
