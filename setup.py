format, instrumenting most high-level installation tasks for this package.

# ....................{ TODO                              }....................
#FIXME: Generate documentation from the NumPy-style docstrings embedded
#throughout this codebase, presumably with Sphinx + napoleon.
#FIXME: Publish generated documentation to readthedocs.org.
#FIXME: Automate generation and publication of documentation in a manner
#synchronized with our stable release (and possibly CI) process.

# Explicitly register all files and subdirectories of the root directory
# containing this top-level "setup.py" script to be importable modules and
# packages (respectively) for the remainder of this Python process if this
# directory has yet to be registered.
#
# Technically, this should *NOT* be required. The current build framework
# (e.g., "pip", "setuptools") should implicitly guarantee this to be the case.
# Indeed, the "setuptools"-based "easy_install" script does just that.
# Unfortunately, "pip" >= 19.0.0 does *NOT* guarantee this to be the case for
# projects defining a "pyproject.toml" file -- which, increasingly, is all of
# them. Although "pip" purports to have resolved this upstream, current stable
# releases appear to suffer the same deficiencies. See also:
#     https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/6163
